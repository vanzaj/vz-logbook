## New course: Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because many folks in data science have not been exposed to good product development practices (XP + BDD + CI/CD).
I did 2 trial iteration is done (with a small class, 4-5 people). Feedback is good, but day 2 needs some improvements (API testing, mocking, and ML specific testing). 2 days is clearly not enough. Current version is 3 days or 2.5 days with some content skipped.

## Establishing weekly routine

1. Weekly plan. Monday morning: make a plan for upcoming week. Friday afternoon: review the week.
1. Daily morning mental exercises for 30min. Learning Bahasa Indonesia using physical flashcards. Learning crypto from [brilliant](https://brilliant.org/courses/cryptocurrency/).
