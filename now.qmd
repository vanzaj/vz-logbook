## New course: Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because many folks in data science have not been exposed to good product development practices (XP + BDD).
The 1st iteration is done (trialed on a small class with 4 people). Feedback is good, but day 2 needs some improvements (API testing, mocking). Add material from Allen Downey books and courses.
