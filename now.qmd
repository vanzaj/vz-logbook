## New course: Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because many folks in data science have not been exposed to good product development practices (XP + BDD).
The 1st iteration is done (trialed on a small class with 4 people). Feedback is good, but day 2 needs some improvements (API testing, mocking). Add material from Allen Downey books and courses.

## Establishing weekly routine

1. Weekly plan. Monday morning: make a plan for upcoming week. Friday afternoon: review the week.
2. Start "self-reflection journal" using [We are not really strangers](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/collections/games/products/self-reflection-kit) cards (1 hour/week).
3. Add/update my [digital garden](https://vanzaj.github.io/vz-logbook/) (1 hour/week).
