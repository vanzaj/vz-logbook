## Rakyat Press

Indie publishing of original and translated works in local languages in the spirit of what Volkswagen was supposed to be for common folks.
Why? 1/ Translation is as hard and creative as producing the original content. Yet translators are payed by the number of words/lines/pages, and never get royalties based on the sales of their work. This is not right. 2/ LLMs and training data is way too dominated by English which can't be a good thing in the long term.


## Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because many folks in data science have not been exposed to good product development practices (XP + BDD + CI/CD).
I did 2 trial iteration is done (with a small class, 4-5 people). Feedback is good, but day 2 needs some improvements (API testing, mocking, and ML specific testing). 2 days is a bit too short. Current version is 3 days or 2.5 days with some content skipped.


## Bike clinic

Everywhere I walk in Singapore, I see abandoned (rusted, flat tires) bycicles. I pick them up, leave my phone number, and ressurect them.
