## Rakyat Press

Indie publishing of the original and translated works in local languages in the spirit of what Volkswagen was supposed to be for common folks.

Why?

1: Translation is as hard and creative as producing the original content. Yet translators are payed by the number of words/lines/pages, and never get royalties based on the sales of their work. This is not right. See [Le Ton beau de Marot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Ton_beau_de_Marot) by Douglas Hofstadter.

2: LLMs and training data is way too dominated by English, which can't be a good thing in the long term.


## Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because way too many folks in data science have not been exposed to good product development practices (XP + BDD + CI/CD).
I did a few trial iterations with small classes of 4-5 people. Feedback is good, but 2 days is not enough. Needs some improvements with a common setup, API testing, mocking, and ML specific testing. Current version is 3 days or 2.5 days with some content skipped.


## Bike clinic

Everywhere I walk in Singapore, I see abandoned (rusted, flat tires) bicycles. I pick them up, leave my phone number, resurrect them, and resell on [Carousell](https://www.carousell.sg/).
