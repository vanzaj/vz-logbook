## Work

### New course: Test driven development for data scientists

Why? Because many folks in data science have not been exposed to agile product development practices.
The 1st iteration is done (trialed on a small class with 4 people). Feedback is good, but day 2 needs some improvements (API testing, mocking).

### Redesign odd-e.com

1. It is too dark and obviously "designed" without UX expert help.
2. Not mobile friendly.


## Establishing weekly routine

1. Weekly plan using spreadsheet. Monday morning: make a plan for upcoming week. Friday afternoon: review the week.
2. Start "self-reflection journal" using [We are not really strangers](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/collections/games/products/self-reflection-kit) cards (1 hour, 1/week).
3. Add/update my [digital garden](https://vanzaj.github.io/vz-logbook/) (1 hour, 1/week)


## Learning

1. A Philosophy of Software Design (2ed).
2. [Introduction to Complexity](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/165-introduction-to-complexity).
3. Chess by Garry Kasparov on masterclass.com.
