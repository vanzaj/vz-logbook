title: TDD katas for Data Scientists

Whenever I talk about TDD to data science and data engineering folks they say either 1) TDD is not working for algorithmic work, or 2) I've tried FizzBuzz and it is not fun. I can understand. Most katas in places like [kata-log](https://kata-log.rocks/) are more CS/SW dev oriented.

So, I've dicided to come up with some katas that might be more intersting for DS folks. Here they are.


## ModPlus (algo)

ModPlus is a simple hashing algorithm. It takes in a positive integer X and returns a combinatorial sum of a binary representation of X after it is split into chunks of given length.

For example, `modplus(12, chunk_length=3)` should return 6.


## 2D vector (design)

Imagine you are working for Khan Academy (KA). KA wants to modernize their basic math classes, especially the display.
Implement a cartesian 2D `Vector` class, that supports scalar multiplication, addition with another `Vector` and norm (magnitude) (see [vector](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vector.html)).
