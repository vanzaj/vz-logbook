    "text": "General chapter on what is evidence-based medicine using bloodletting as a historic example of how long established treatment methods can be challenged. Bloodletting was already used in ancient Greece and continued to be widely used until 1850’s as a treatment option to many conditions. In 1799 George_Washington got pneumonia and died supposedly from extensive bloodletting. In the same year there was probably the first famous court case about medical malpractice between Benjamin Rush and William Cobbett. Rush was a rather famous and established doctor and politician and easily won the case.\nAt that time the idea of conducting clinical trials to establish the efficiency of treatment was not yet accepted by the medical establishment. However, first attempts to conduct such trials to have been performed by James Lind in 1747 in an attempt to establish the treatment for scurvy. Scurvy was a disease that affected a large number of sailors (many more death due to scurvy than anything else including war injuries). Lind isolated 12 sailors, separated them in 6 pairs, gave similar diet, but different treatments. He correctly observed that citrus fruit improved patients condition. The link to vitamin C was already known at that time, but wasn’t widely accepted. Lind failed to publish his results. In 1780 Gilbert Blane repeated Lind’s experiment involving many more subjects and managed to convince the British navy to make mandatory use of lime juice to prevent scurvy (hence “limey”).\nThe first trial that questioned the efficiency of bloodletting was supposedly conducted by Alexander Lesassier Hamilton in 1809. He introduced random patient assignment between 3 doctors and showed that the mortality rates were much lower in the two groups where bloodletting wasn’t used. He failed to publish and disseminate his results. It was Pierre Charles Louis, a French physician, who reconfirmed inefficiency of bloodletting for treatment of fevers in 1828. His “numerical method” was strongly opposed by the medical community.\nOther examples of how evidence was used to advance medical practice are the stories of Florence Nightingale, who demonstrated the importance of hygiene in military hospitals during Crimean war (1853-1856) using mortality statistics, and the British Doctors Study by Hill and Doll in the early 1950’s that demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer (first prospective cohort study, used doctors as subjects in order to get a more homogeneous sample population).\n\nEvidence based medicine can be used to decide what works, what does not work, efficiency of preventive methods, and what causes the disease.\n\n\nEvidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. – David Sackett\n\n\nAll great truth begin as blasphemies. Not all blasphemies become great truth. –Bernard Shaw\n\nOther good source of info: jameslindlibrary.",

    "text": "Solutions to complex problems take many dissimilar minds and points of view.\n\nConnective thinking.\n\nAlbino boy\n( &lt; &gt; ) knee bend direction, “I am greater/lesser than you”\n\nContaining the excesses of malignant narcissists is a team effort… Engaging with them (narcissists) alone is futile – never wrestle a pig – as the old saying goes; you both end up covered in shit, and the pig likes it.\n\n\nThe basic protocols of Aboriginal society, like most societies, include respecting and hearing all points of view in a yarn. Narcissists demand this right, then refuse to allow other points of view on the grounds that any other opinion somehow infringes their freedom of speech or is offensive.\n\n\nEveryone is an idiot from time to time.\n\n\n\nFirst Law\n(three circles and flowers)\n\nAfter my yarns with Percy, I begin to see the uncertainty principle not as a law but as an expression of frustration about the impossibility of achieving godlike scientific objectivity.\n\n\n\nForever limited\n\nSustainable systems cannot be manufactured by individuals or appointed committees, particularly during times of intense transition and upheaval.\n\n\nIdeas can be re-engineered to serve the interests of the powerful.\n\n(chekout Larry Gross, Post Apocaliptic Stress Syndrom).\n\n\nLines in the sand\n\nPeople today will mostly focus on the points of connection, the nodes of interest like stars in the sky. But the real understanding comes in the spaces in between, in the relational forces that connect and move the points.\n\n\nSystems are heterarchical – composed of equal parts interacting together. Imposing a hierarchical model of top-down control can only destroy them. Healthy interventions can only be made by free agents within a complex system.\n\n\nOn learning another culture (cultural humility): 1) Check your ego and motives, 2) You don’t need to be an expert to understand the knowledge process of people from other cultures and enter into dialogues with them (but you need to show respect), 3) Making yourself an expert in another culture is not always appreciated by the members of that culture.\n\n\nIt is difficult to relinquish the illusions of power and delusions of exceptionalism that come with privilege. But it is strangely liberating to realise your true status as a single node in a cooperative network.\n\n\nSustainable systems cannot function without the full autonomy and unique expression of each independent part of the interdependent whole.\n\n\nSustainability agents have a few simple operating guidelines, or network protocols, or rules if you like – connect, diversify, interact and adapt.\n\n\nAn agent that is truly adaptive and changing is open to sudden eruptions of transformation.\n\n\nNot all strange attractors are benevolent (narcissist).\n\n\nAdolescent cultures always ask the same three questions. Why are we here? How should we live? What will happen when we die?\n\n\n\nOf Spirit and Spirits\n\nThere are at least four parts to your spirit from an Aboriginal point of view: your higher self (superego), ancestral spirit, living spirit and shadow spirit… Your shadow spirit is that part of you that wants things you don’t need, makes you think you’re better than other people and above the land. If the rest of your spirit is not clear and in balance, it gets away from you, causing conflict and destruction. You gossip behind people’s backs, spread uncertainty, deliver judgments, upset people, take more than you need and accumulate goods without sharing. It makes you a competitor instead of a human being.\n\n                   =     metaphors   \n                //   \\\\    \nabstract       o      o   concrete\n                \\\\   //\n                   =    metaphors\n\nThere is a spark of creation like lightning when true learning takes place, with a genetic reward of chemical pleasure released in the brain… The chemical burst of pleasure we feel when genuine knowledge transmission takes place occurs from the creation of new neural pathways. These are connections between two points that were previously unconnected. Jokes are one of the most pure examples of this neural creation event… If people are laughing, they are learning.\n\n\nThere needs to be an interaction between abstract (spirit) and concrete (physical) worlds of knowledge for this kind of complexity to develop fully.\n\n\nWithout closing the loop between abstract knowledge and reality, and without making connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge, true learning cannot occur.\n\n\nA focus on linear, abstract, declarative knowledge alone not only fails to create complex connectivity but damages the mind. We are biologically punished for this destructive behaviour with a neuro-chemical rush of lethargy and discomfort that most people call boredom.\n\n\nKnowledge transmission must connect both abstract knowledge and concrete application through meaningful metaphors to be effective.\n\n\n\nAdvanced and Fair\nTODO",

    "text": "language and the words you use say a lot about a culture, and that we can take steps to change culture through changing those words. – Emily Webber\n\nThe above quote is from a short and sweet “Should you call people resources?” post which resonated with me. I don’t remember when the term “resource” applied to people started to bother me. It’s been a while, but usually I didn’t do anything about it. Last year I decided to engage with an HR admin in a bank where I worked as an external consultant. She kept referring to me and my colleagues as “external resources” in emails. I’d asked her to stop calling us that, but either she had ignored my request or thought it wasn’t important and continued to call us “ER”s. I repeated my request accompanied by a small explanation why people are not resources thinking that sensible people especially working in HR would have no problem understanding it. Her reply: “but it is just a classification in our internal IT system”…\nSome of my HR friends say that the R-word is slowly disappearing from their industry’s lexicon and that organization adopt Google’s “People Operation” or similar (hopefully not just borrowing the term and being done with it). I like this development.\nWhat about “talent”? It is not as offensive as “resources”, but still might trigger “I’ve got no talents.” Or “I’m not good at this.” And isn’t talent overrated? And what about “human capital” or “human assets”? What is the benefit of using these words and constructs instead of just “people”?",
