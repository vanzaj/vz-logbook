The latter is the secret to concentration. Walking, cycling, micro-falling and micro-recovering.\nMindfulness meditation practices: 1) Easy way – pay attention to the process of breathing and gently bring attention back every time it wanders away, 2) Easier way – shift from doing to being, just be without agenda for 2 minutes. Sit in a comfortable pose that allows to be both relaxed and alert. Bring attention to the process of breathing. If the mind gets distracted by a sound, or an itch, acknowledge the source of distraction, experience it without judging, and let it go if it wants to be let go. If you need to move, maintain mindfulness of intention, movement and sensation. If self-criticism or self-judgment arises, invite a thought of self-directed kindness to arise.",

Expensive and cheap food meditation. Walking meditation: standing, lifting one foot, moving foot, placing foot on the ground, stopping, turning, changing speed. Office to restroom.\nMindful listening exercise (10 min): speaker-listener pair, 3 minutes monologue, listener gives full attention to the speaker, no questions allowed, only “I see” or “I understand”, give space to silence. Switch roles. Have a meta-conversation at the end. Suggested topics: “what are you feeling right now?”, “what is something that happened today that you want to talk about?”, “anything you want to talk about?”\nOur attention is the most valuable gift we can give to others.\nMindful conversation: mindful listening, looping (listener tells the speaker what he or she heard), dipping (self-checkin). How to listen and do self-checkin at the same time? Central vision (attention on other) and peripheral vision (attention on self).\nTips for practicing mindfulness: 1) Have a buddy, 2) do less than you can(one mindful breath a day), 3) self-checkin (how am i doing with my commitment to my practice, what has arisen in my life that relates to my practice)\nphysical fitness: strength and stamina (circuit interval training, cardio, resistance) attention: focused (intense focus on a chosen object) and open attention (willingness to meet any object that arrives in the mind)\nMeditation circuit training: rest the mind, 3 min of focused attention, 3 min of open attention.\nZen and a baby learning to walk.

Self-awareness allows emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment, self-confidence and self-motivation. All systems have failure modes, recovery modes.\nSelf-awareness and mindfulness are the same thing. Mindfulness training is self-awareness training. To train physical-emotional self-knowledge we can use “body scan”. Journaling develops self-honesty and self-assessment.\nBody-scan from Mindfulness-based stress reduction course (Jon Kabat-Zinn): bring attention to different body parts starting from the top of our head and moving down to the tips of our toes (or vice versa). The important thing is attention, not sensation. It doesn’t matter if you experience sensation or not, it only matters that you pay attention.\nSIY practice:\neasy meditation: 2 min body scan: 6 min (head, face, neck and shoulders, back front, entire body) positive emotion body scan: 3 min (think of a positive emotion or any happy event, bring attention to the body) easy meditation: 2 min (return to grounding)\nJournaling prompts:\n\nWhat I am feeling now is …\nI am aware that …\nWhat motivates me is …\nI am inspired by …\nToday, I aspire to …\nThings that give me pleasure are…\nMy strengths are…\nWhat hurts me is…\nI wish…\nOthers are…\nI made a happy mistake…\nLove is…\nThings that annoy me are…\nMy weaknesses are …\n\nTry priming before writing: spend 2 minutes thinking about one or more instances in which you responded positively to a challenging situation and the outcome was very satisfying.\nThoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind and body that come and go (clouds in the sky).",

Narcissists demand this right, then refuse to allow other points of view on the grounds that any other opinion somehow infringes their freedom of speech or is offensive.\n\n\nEveryone is an idiot from time to time.\n\n\n\nFirst Law\n(three circles and flowers)\n\nAfter my yarns with Percy, I begin to see the uncertainty principle not as a law but as an expression of frustration about the impossibility of achieving godlike scientific objectivity.\n\n\n\nForever limited\n\nSustainable systems cannot be manufactured by individuals or appointed committees, particularly during times of intense transition and upheaval.\n\n\nIdeas can be re-engineered to serve the interests of the powerful.\n\n(chekout Larry Gross, Post Apocaliptic Stress Syndrom).\n\n\nLines in the sand\n\nPeople today will mostly focus on the points of connection, the nodes of interest like stars in the sky. But the real understanding comes in the spaces in between, in the relational forces that connect and move the points.\n\n\nSystems are heterarchical – composed of equal parts interacting together. Imposing a hierarchical model of top-down control can only destroy them. Healthy interventions can only be made by free agents within a complex system.\n\n\nOn learning another culture (cultural humility): 1) Check your ego and motives, 2) You don’t need to be an expert to understand the knowledge process of people from other cultures and enter into dialogues with them (but you need to show respect), 3) Making yourself an expert in another culture is not always appreciated by the members of that culture.\n\n\nIt is difficult to relinquish the illusions of power and delusions of exceptionalism that come with privilege. But it is strangely liberating to realise your true status as a single node in a cooperative network.\n\n\nSustainable systems cannot function without the full autonomy and unique expression of each independent part of the interdependent whole.\n\n\nSustainability agents have a few simple operating guidelines, or network protocols, or rules if you like – connect, diversify, interact and adapt.\n\n\nAn agent that is truly adaptive and changing is open to sudden eruptions of transformation.\n\n\nNot all strange attractors are benevolent (narcissist).\n\n\nAdolescent cultures always ask the same three questions. Why are we here? How should we live? What will happen when we die?\n\n\n\nOf Spirit and Spirits\n\nThere are at least four parts to your spirit from an Aboriginal point of view: your higher self (superego), ancestral spirit, living spirit and shadow spirit… Your shadow spirit is that part of you that wants things you don’t need, makes you think you’re better than other people and above the land. If the rest of your spirit is not clear and in balance, it gets away from you, causing conflict and destruction. You gossip behind people’s backs, spread uncertainty, deliver judgments, upset people, take more than you need and accumulate goods without sharing. It makes you a competitor instead of a human being.\n\n                   =     metaphors   \n                //   \\\\    \nabstract       o      o   concrete\n                \\\\   //\n                   =    metaphors\n\nThere is a spark of creation like lightning when true learning takes place, with a genetic reward of chemical pleasure released in the brain… The chemical burst of pleasure we feel when genuine knowledge transmission takes place occurs from the creation of new neural pathways. These are connections between two points that were previously unconnected. Jokes are one of the most pure examples of this neural creation event… If people are laughing, they are learning.\n\n\nThere needs to be an interaction between abstract (spirit) and concrete (physical) worlds of knowledge for this kind of complexity to develop fully.\n\n\nWithout closing the loop between abstract knowledge and reality, and without making connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge, true learning cannot occur.\n\n\nA focus on linear, abstract, declarative knowledge alone not only fails to create complex connectivity but damages the mind. We are biologically punished for this destructive behaviour with a neuro-chemical rush of lethargy and discomfort that most people call boredom.\n\n\nKnowledge transmission must connect both abstract knowledge and concrete application through meaningful metaphors to be effective.\n\n\n\nAdvanced and Fair\nTODO",

I don’t remember when the term “resource” applied to people started to bother me. It’s been a while, but usually I didn’t do anything about it. Last year I decided to engage with an HR admin in a bank where I worked as an external consultant. She kept referring to me and my colleagues as “external resources” in emails. I’d asked her to stop calling us that, but either she had ignored my request or thought it wasn’t important and continued to call us “ER”s. I repeated my request accompanied by a small explanation why people are not resources thinking that sensible people especially working in HR would have no problem understanding it. Her reply: “but it is just a classification in our internal IT system”…\nSome of my HR friends say that the R-word is slowly disappearing from their industry’s lexicon and that organization adopt Google’s “People Operation” or similar (hopefully not just borrowing the term and being done with it). I like this development.\nWhat about “talent”? It is not as offensive as “resources”, but still might trigger “I’ve got no talents.” Or “I’m not good at this.” And isn’t talent overrated? And what about “human capital” or “human assets”? What is the benefit of using these words and constructs instead of just “people”?",

Data can be persisted in named volumes inside /var/lib/docker/volumes (volume mount) or a directory on a host (bind mount).\ndocker volume create my_volume\ndocker run -v my_volume:/var/log my_image\n\n# new explicit format for mounting volumes\ndocker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/my_image/logs,target=/var/log my_image\n\n\nDocker compose\nIt’s possible to run multiple containers and “link” them for networking. But much easier to use docker-compose to manage multi-container app.\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: 2\n\nservices:\n  frontend:\n    build:\n      context: ./app\n      args:\n        DB_HOST: localhost:5005\n    links:\n      - db\n    volumes:\n      - logs:/var/logs\n    depends_on:\n      db:\n        condition: service_started\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n    ports:\n      - \"5005:5432\"\n    volumes:\n      - /data/app/postgres:/var/lib/postgres\n\nvolumes:\n  logs:\ndocker-compose up -d   #--build\ndocker-compose exec frontend ls -l\ndocker-compose logs frontend\ndocker-compose down -v",
