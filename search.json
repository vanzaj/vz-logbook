    "text": "Why managers exist? Why org structures exist?\nHow does a bad org structure look like? Rank (position in a hierarchy) is used as a tool of oppression. Information hoarding, playing dominance games (politics). Decisions are made based on rank.\nHierarchy is a property of self-organizing systems.\n\nA system is “a network of interdependent components that work together to try to accomplish a common aim.” – W. Edward Deming.\n\nA subsystem is a collection of elements with a smaller aim inside a larger system. The sybsystems always work to support the needs of the larger system; if the sybsystem instead optimizes for its own best interest, the whole system can fail.\nA system is self-organizing if it has the ability to make itself more complex, by diversifying, adapting, and improving itself. As systems self-organize and their complexity increases, they tend to generate hierarchy – an arrangement of systems and subsystems. In a stable, resilient and efficient system, sybsystems can largely take care of themselves, regulate themselves, and serve the needs of the larger system, while the larger system coordinates between subsystems and helps them perform better. Hierarchy minimizes the costs of coordination and reduces the amount of information that any given part of the system has to keep track of, preventing information overload. Information transfer and relationships withing a sybsystem are more more dense and have fewer delays than information transfer or relationshions between subsystems.\nA manager’s job is to coordinate between teams and help their team perform better.\nSoftware product development organizations are socio-technical systems, but the separation between “socio/people” and “technical/engineering” is never clean. Need for “glue work”.\nTasks that need to be done by any functional engineering org besides writing code:\n\nRecruiting: networking, interviewing, writing job descriptions and career ladders.\nProject management: managing stakeholders, prioritizing backlog, estimating size and scope.\nRunning team meetings: 1x1s (growth feedback), retrospectives, writing reviews, representing the teams’s needs.\nArchitecture, code reviews, capturing DORA and productivity metrics, managing burnout."

    "section": "Engineering managers are a useful abstraction.",
    "text": "Engineering managers are a useful abstraction.\nOne of the primary benefits of hierarchy is to reduce information overload. Engineering labor takes concentration and focus. Context switching is expensive. Management labor consist of context switching every hour or so, and being available for interruptions throughtout the day. Engineering calendar and management calendar do not coexist well.\nIt isn’t up to managers to do all the glue work, but it is a manager’s job to make sure that everything that needs to get done, does gets done (requires providing necessary resources to people who do the actual work).\nAn engineer is responsible for the software she develops, deploys, and maintains. A manager is responsible for her team and the organization as a whole.\nIn natural hierarchies, we look up for purpose and down for function. The above makes a complicated argument for why we need engineering managers.\nThe simpler argument is that most engineering orgs have engineering managers. It is something that many smart people had to spend considerable time thinking about. It may sound “boring”, but actually it is like with “choosing boring technology” which means “the capabilities and failure conditions are well understood”.\nWhen there is no explicit structure or hierarchy, the result is not freedom and egalitarianism (see The Tyranny of Structureless). Such orgs tend to be chaotic, fragile and frustrating.\nNo EMs because of management overhead (because managers are not supposed to do tech work) is a flawed argument. Mostly because “productivity” does not equate “lines of code”."

    "text": "Just like people, organizations use signalling to communicate with the rest of the world. SEC filing, branding campaigns, industry awards are obvious mechanisms. Certifications like ISO 9001 are useful for getting contractual agreements. There are also more subtle signals. For example B-corp certification means that a for-profit organization puts social sustainability above profit, while worldblue membership signals a cultural shift from traditional command-and-control to a more progressive organization.\nBut there are also organizations that don’t bother with certifications and branding. They just focus on doing good work and leave signalling to word-of-mouth. Corporate Rebels and their bucketlist are currently the best source of information on such organizations. Happy to see Odd-e appearing in the list."

    "text": "General chapter on what is evidence-based medicine using bloodletting as a historic example of how long established treatment methods can be challenged. Bloodletting was already used in ancient Greece and continued to be widely used until 1850’s as a treatment option to many conditions. In 1799 George_Washington got pneumonia and died supposedly from extensive bloodletting. In the same year there was probably the first famous court case about medical malpractice between Benjamin Rush and William Cobbett. Rush was a rather famous and established doctor and politician and easily won the case.\nAt that time the idea of conducting clinical trials to establish the efficiency of treatment was not yet accepted by the medical establishment. However, first attempts to conduct such trials to have been performed by James Lind in 1747 in an attempt to establish the treatment for scurvy. Scurvy was a disease that affected a large number of sailors (many more death due to scurvy than anything else including war injuries). Lind isolated 12 sailors, separated them in 6 pairs, gave similar diet, but different treatments. He correctly observed that citrus fruit improved patients condition. The link to vitamin C was already known at that time, but wasn’t widely accepted. Lind failed to publish his results. In 1780 Gilbert Blane repeated Lind’s experiment involving many more subjects and managed to convince the British navy to make mandatory use of lime juice to prevent scurvy (hence “limey”).\nThe first trial that questioned the efficiency of bloodletting was supposedly conducted by Alexander Lesassier Hamilton in 1809. He introduced random patient assignment between 3 doctors and showed that the mortality rates were much lower in the two groups where bloodletting wasn’t used. He failed to publish and disseminate his results. It was Pierre Charles Louis, a French physician, who reconfirmed inefficiency of bloodletting for treatment of fevers in 1828. His “numerical method” was strongly opposed by the medical community.\nOther examples of how evidence was used to advance medical practice are the stories of Florence Nightingale, who demonstrated the importance of hygiene in military hospitals during Crimean war (1853-1856) using mortality statistics, and the British Doctors Study by Hill and Doll in the early 1950’s that demonstrated the link between smoking and lung cancer (first prospective cohort study, used doctors as subjects in order to get a more homogeneous sample population).\n\nEvidence based medicine can be used to decide what works, what does not work, efficiency of preventive methods, and what causes the disease.\n\n\nEvidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. – David Sackett\n\n\nAll great truth begin as blasphemies. Not all blasphemies become great truth. –Bernard Shaw\n\nOther good source of info: jameslindlibrary."

If the rest of your spirit is not clear and in balance, it gets away from you, causing conflict and destruction.

We are biologically punished for this destructive behaviour with a neuro-chemical rush of lethargy and discomfort that most people call boredom.\n\n\nKnowledge transmission must connect both abstract knowledge and concrete application through meaningful metaphors to be effective."

    "text": "P: Give me a few know examples of famous technologists who frequently use pair programming in their daily work.\nFinding famous technologists who daily practice pair programming is rare because many move into management or architectural roles. However, there are a few legendary examples of “hands-on” titans who used it to build some of the most critical software in history, as well as the methodology creators who evangelized it.\n\n1. The Most Famous Duo: Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat\nThese two are arguably the most effective pair programmers in the history of Silicon Valley. They are Senior Fellows at Google (the highest technical level) and are responsible for building the foundational systems of the modern internet: MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, and LevelDB.\n\nHow they worked: For years, they worked at the same computer, sharing a keyboard and monitor. They would often finish each other’s sentences and code.\nThe “Chuck Norris” Fact: There is a famous internal joke at Google that “Jeff Dean’s compiler warns him about errors,” but in reality, his “compiler” was often Sanjay sitting next to him.\nWhy it mattered: Their pairing allowed them to build massive, complex distributed systems that were exceptionally bug-free and efficient because they were constantly reviewing each other’s logic in real-time.\n\n\n\n2. The Creator: Kent Beck\nKent Beck is the father of Extreme Programming (XP), the software methodology that popularized pair programming in the 1990s. He is also the creator of JUnit and Test Driven Development (TDD).\n\nHis Daily Habit: While he moves between roles (Meta, Gusto, etc.), he treats pair programming as a discipline rather than a suggestion. He famously stated that for complex or production-critical code, he does not work alone.\nThe Philosophy: He argues that “code reviews” are too late in the process. Pairing is a continuous, real-time code review that prevents bad design decisions before they are written.\n\n\n\n3. The Craftsman: Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”)\nA signatory of the Agile Manifesto and author of Clean Code, Uncle Bob is a vocal advocate for professionalism in coding, which he believes often requires pairing.\n\nHis Approach: He advocates for pairing particularly when solving “deep” problems or training junior developers. He views it as a transfer of professional standards—teaching not just what to code, but how to think about code.\nThe “Ping Pong” Method: He frequently demonstrates and uses “Ping Pong Pairing,” where one person writes a failing test (TDD), passes the keyboard to the other to make it pass, who then writes the next failing test, and passes it back.\n\n\n\n4. The Thought Leader: Martin Fowler\nAs a Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks and a prolific author (Refactoring, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture), Fowler has institutionalized pair programming at an organizational level.\n\nDaily Work: While he writes more prose than code these days, his daily work involves “pairing” on technical articles and architectural designs. He advocates that pairing is just as effective for writing documentation and design specs as it is for code.\nInfluence: Under his technical guidance, companies like ThoughtWorks require consultants to pair program 100% of the time, proving it works at scale in daily enterprise work.\n\n\n\nSummary: Why they do it\nThese technologists don’t pair program because they are “slow” or need help. They do it because:\n\nImmediate Feedback: Bugs are caught in seconds, not days.\nFocus: It is much harder to procrastinate or check Twitter when someone is watching you code.\nBus Factor: No single person “owns” the code; the knowledge is shared instantly."

    "text": "P: What about creators of UNIX and C programming language?\nYes, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie are arguably the “original” pair programmers, long before the term existed.\nWhile they didn’t have a formal “Agile” manifesto, their working style at Bell Labs in the late 1960s and 70s is exactly what modern pair programming aims to emulate.\n\nThe “Proto-Pairing” of Thompson and Ritchie\nThey are the ultimate example of informal, high-bandwidth collaboration.\n\nThe Hardware Constraint: In the early days, they were working on a PDP-7 and later a PDP-11. These were massive machines but often had limited terminals. It was physically natural to sit side-by-side at the teletype to debug the kernel or language features together.\nThe Workflow: Thompson (the rapid-fire hacker) would often write the initial implementation of a UNIX feature, and Ritchie (the theoretician and language designer) would refine the C language to support it, often in the same room, effectively “pairing” on the architecture of the system.\nThe “Rubber Duck” Effect: They served as each other’s immediate feedback loop. If Thompson hit a roadblock in the OS, Ritchie was there to adjust the C compiler to fix it, and vice versa. This tight loop is why UNIX and C fit together so perfectly—they evolved simultaneously in the same room.\n\n\n\nOther Historical Examples of “De Facto” Pairing\nBefore it was a named methodology, many early computing breakthroughs came from duos who shared a brain (and often a keyboard):\n\nBill Gates and Paul Allen (Microsoft Basic): In the famous “crunch mode” to write the BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, they worked non-stop for weeks. One would write the assembly code while the other verified the logic and manually calculated memory addresses (since they had no assembler). This was “Driver-Navigator” pairing in its rawest form.\nSteve Wozniak and Steve Jobs (Breakout): While Wozniak was the primary engineer, the development of the arcade game Breakout for Atari involved Jobs staying up four nights straight with Wozniak. Jobs (who couldn’t design circuits) acted as the “Navigator/Product Owner,” reviewing the game mechanics and motivating Wozniak to reduce the chip count, while Wozniak (“The Driver”) executed the design.\n\n\n\nWhy this matters\nThe creators of UNIX and C prove that pair programming isn’t just a training tool for juniors; it is a discovery tool for masters. When two experts pair, they don’t just write code faster—they invent entirely new paradigms (like the pipe | operator, which was debated and refined in that collaborative environment)."

    "text": "P: Who are famous technical coaches who teach and promote pair programming and TDD?\nBeyond the legendary creators, there is a vibrant community of “Technical Coaches”—professionals who literally make a living teaching teams how to pair program and practice Test Driven Development (TDD).\nHere are the most famous technical coaches active today, each known for a specific “style” or contribution to the field.\n\n1. The “Strong-Style” Specialist: Llewellyn Falco\nLlewellyn is famous for defining Strong-Style Pairing, a specific technique designed to force collaboration and prevent the “Driver” (typist) from ignoring the “Navigator.”\n\nHis Golden Rule: “For an idea to go from your head into the computer, it must go through someone else’s hands.”\nHow it works: If you are the Navigator and you know exactly what to type, you cannot type it. You must verbally describe it to the Driver. If the Driver doesn’t understand, you don’t grab the keyboard; you must explain it better.\nWhy he teaches it: It forces high-bandwidth communication and ensures the Navigator stays engaged, fixing the common problem where the Navigator “zones out.”\n\n\n\n2. The Dojo Master: Emily Bache\nEmily Bache is arguably the world’s leading expert on Technical Coaching and Coding Dojos. She wrote the book The Coding Dojo Handbook and popularized the famous “Gilded Rose” refactoring kata.\n\nThe “Samman” Method: She developed the Samman Technical Coaching method, where a coach works with a team in two modes:\n\nLearning Hour: Practicing safe, small exercises (Katas) away from production code.\nThe Ensemble: Working on the actual production code as a group (Mob Programming) to apply the new skills immediately.\n\nWhy she matters: She focuses on “Ensemble Programming” (Mob Programming) as the primary way to teach TDD, arguing that learning is faster when the whole team learns together rather than in isolated pairs.\n\n\n\n3. The Craftsman: Sandro Mancuso\nSandro Mancuso founded the Software Craftsmanship movement in London and wrote The Software Craftsman. He teaches that TDD and Pairing are not just “Agile tricks” but ethical obligations of a professional.\n\nHis Focus: He focuses on Professionalism. He teaches that writing “dirty code” is unprofessional in the same way a surgeon leaving tools inside a patient is unprofessional.\nThe “Bank Kata”: He frequently uses a “Bank Kata” to teach “Outside-In TDD” (or London School TDD), where you start with the high-level API and use “Mock Objects” to design the system top-down, pairing closely to define interfaces before implementation.\n\n\n\n4. The Philosopher: J.B. Rainsberger\nJ.B. (famous for “J.B.rains”) is a coach who focuses heavily on the psychology and design aspects of TDD.\n\nHis Mantra: “TDD is a design technique, not a testing technique.”\nThe Lesson: He teaches that if TDD is painful, your design is bad. He uses pairing sessions to show developers that their “hard to test” code is actually “highly coupled” code. He helps teams realize that the pain they feel when pairing or testing is a signal to refactor the architecture, not to stop testing.\n\n\n\n5. The Mob Evangelist: Woody Zuill\nWhile Llewellyn Falco formalized the “Strong Style” of pairing, Woody Zuill took it to the extreme by popularizing Mob Programming (now often called Software Teaming or Ensemble Programming).\n\nThe “Turn Up The Good” Philosophy: He noticed that when his team fixed bugs together on one screen, they were faster and happier. So he asked, “If this is good, why don’t we turn up the good?” and they started working on everything together, all day, every day.\nHis Coaching Style: He is famous for a very gentle, humane approach. He focuses on kindness, consideration, and respect in the pairing/mobbing environment, proving that psychological safety is the precursor to technical excellence.\n\n\n\nSummary Table: Which Coach for Which Problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach\nBest For…\nKey Concept\n\n\n\n\nLlewellyn Falco\nTeams where the Navigator zones out.\nStrong-Style Pairing (Idea \\(\\to\\) Voice \\(\\to\\) Hands)\n\n\nEmily Bache\nTeams that need structured practice.\nCoding Dojos & Samman Method\n\n\nSandro Mancuso\nTeams needing professional discipline.\nSoftware Craftsmanship\n\n\nJ.B.

    "section": "P: What research is available on the impact of excellent but toxic/egoistic on team/org performance?",
    "text": "P: What research is available on the impact of excellent but toxic/egoistic on team/org performance?\nResearch indicates that while “brilliant jerks” (often called toxic high performers) may deliver short-term individual results, their net impact on an organization is almost universally negative.\nThe following analysis details the key research findings on how these individuals affect team dynamics and organizational behavior.\n\n1. The Economic Case: Cost vs. Benefit\nThe most direct research challenges the assumption that high output justifies bad behavior.\nThe “Toxic Worker” Study (Harvard Business School): A study of nearly 60,000 workers by Dylan Minor and Michael Housman found that avoiding a toxic employee is worth twice as much as hiring a superstar.\nThe Math: Hiring a top 1% performer adds roughly $5,300 in productivity gains. However, avoiding a toxic worker saves approximately $12,500 in turnover and replacement costs.\nConclusion: It is more profitable to avoid toxicity than to chase brilliance.\n\n\n2. The “Bad Apple” Effect on Teams\nResearch confirms that toxicity is contagious and disproportionately damaging to group performance.\nThe 30–40% Drop (University of Washington/Rotterdam School of Management): Researcher Will Felps conducted a study placing “bad apples” (actors playing roles like “The Jerk,” “The Slacker,” or “The Depressive”) into teams.\nFinding: Teams with just one toxic member saw their performance drop by 30% to 40%.\nMechanism: The toxic behavior didn’t just isolate the “jerk”—it spread. Teammates naturally began to mimic the bad behavior, reduce their own effort, and squabble amongst themselves (“emotional contagion”).\n\n\n3. The “Competent Jerk” Dilemma\nA seminal framework in organizational psychology explains why these people survive in companies despite the damage they cause.\nCasciaro & Lobo (Harvard Business Review): In their study “Competent Jerks, Lovable Fools”, they classified employees by Competence and Likability.\nThe finding: When forced to choose, most people prefer the “Lovable Fool” (low competence, high likability) over the “Competent Jerk” (high competence, low likability).\nThe trap: However, managers often protect Competent Jerks because their individual metrics look good on paper. This creates a disconnect where leadership values the jerk, but the team (who relies on trust and collaboration) is actively sabotaged by them.\n\n\n4. Psychological Impact & Narcissism\nHigh performers with toxic traits often display “rivalrous narcissism,” which is distinct from confident.\nAdmirative vs. Rivalrous Narcissism: Research distinguishes between narcissists who want to be admired (often charismatic and initially effective) and those who are rivalrous (see others as threats).\nImpact: Rivalrous high performers actively suppress team cohesion. They hoard information, steal credit, and create “psychological danger,” stopping others from speaking up or innovating.\nMoral Disengagement: These individuals often use their high performance as a moral license (“I made the most sales, so I can yell at the support staff”), which normalizes abuse within the culture.\n\n\n5. Organizational Long-Term Consequences\nThe research highlights three specific long-term damages:\n\nAsymmetric Turnover: You don’t just lose employees; you lose your best employees. High performers have the most options in the job market and are the least tolerant of toxic peers. They leave; the mediocre employees (who can’t leave) stay and tolerate the abuse.\nInnovation Stagnation: Psychological safety is the #1 predictor of effective teams (Google’s Project Aristotle. Toxic high performers destroy this safety, silencing the debate and risk-taking required for innovation.\nManagerial Credibility: When leaders tolerate a toxic high performer, they signal that “values” are just marketing. This cynicism reduces engagement across the entire organization.\n\n\n\nSummary Table: The Net Impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nHigh Performer (Toxic) Impact\nResearch Basis\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Output\nHigh (initially)\nTraditional Performance Reviews\n\n\nTeam Output\n-30% to -40%\nFelps (Bad Apple Study)\n\n\nFinancial ROI\nNegative (Cost &gt; Gain)\nHBS (Minor/Housman)\n\n\nRetention\nIncreases turnover of other top talent\nGeneral Org Psych\n\n\nCulture\nContagious toxicity (others become toxic)\nEmotional Contagion Theory"

    "text": "P: Please give me a summary of Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow Book by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton.\nHere’s a summary of the book Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton.\nThe book provides a practical and adaptive model for organizing technology and business teams. Its primary goal is to help organizations achieve a fast flow of software delivery by optimizing team structures to reduce dependencies, improve communication, and, most importantly, manage team cognitive load.\n\nThe Core Problem: Cognitive Load\nThe central concept of the book is Team Cognitive Load. This refers to the total amount of mental effort a team is using at any given time. The authors, drawing on psychologist John Sweller’s work, argue that a team, like an individual, has a finite cognitive capacity.\nIf a team is responsible for too many different things (e.g., multiple complex business domains, intricate infrastructure, testing, operations, and user support), its cognitive load becomes too high. This overload is the main blocker to a fast flow of value, leading to:\n\nSlow delivery\nPoor-quality work\nTeam burnout\nAn inability to innovate\n\nThe entire Team Topologies model is designed to explicitly limit and manage the cognitive load of each team.\n\n\nThe Four Fundamental Team Topologies\nThe book proposes that instead of functional silos (like “dev,” “ops,” “QA”), organizations should use only four fundamental types of teams.\n\nStream-aligned Team: This is the primary team type. It’s a cross-functional team aligned to a single, valuable “stream” of work, such as a product, a service, a user journey, or a specific business capability. They are empowered to build, run, and own their service end-to-end, from idea to production and back. The majority of teams in an organization should be stream-aligned.\nPlatform Team: The purpose of a platform team is to enable stream-aligned teams to deliver their work with more autonomy and less effort. They provide internal services and tools (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards, self-service infrastructure) as an internal “product.” This reduces the cognitive load on stream-aligned teams, as they don’t have to be experts in (for example) Kubernetes orchestration.\nEnabling Team: This is a team of specialists (e.g., in security, test automation, or a new technology) who help stream-aligned teams acquire missing capabilities. Their goal is not to do the work for other teams but to “teach them how to fish.” They are temporary and move on once the stream-aligned team is self-sufficient in that area.\nComplicated-subsystem Team: This team is only created when a specific part of the system is so complex that it requires deep, specialized knowledge (e.g., a real-time video processing engine, a complex financial-modeling algorithm). This team builds and maintains that one subsystem, hiding its complexity from other teams (usually platform or stream-aligned) who consume it as a service.\n\n\n\nThe Three Team Interaction Modes\nThe book also defines three specific ways these teams should interact. Using these explicit modes makes communication and dependencies clear, avoiding messy, undefined “coordination.”\n\nCollaboration: Two teams work closely together for a defined, temporary period. This mode is used for rapid discovery and innovation, such as when a stream-aligned team and a platform team are figuring out a new API. It is high-bandwidth but creates a high cognitive load, so it should be used sparingly and with a clear goal.\nX-as-a-Service: This is the most common and desirable mode. One team consumes a service, tool, or API from another (like a platform team) with minimal interaction. This mode works best when the service is reliable, well-documented, and easy to use, as it minimizes the cognitive load on the consuming team.\nFacilitating: One team (usually an enabling team) helps and mentors another team to clear an obstacle or learn a new skill. The goal is to grow the capabilities of the team being facilitated. This is a temporary interaction.\n\n\n\nKey Principles and Goals\n\nFast Flow: The ultimate goal is to optimize the organization for a fast, smooth flow of change into production. The topologies and interaction modes are all in service of this goal.\nReverse Conway’s Law: The book heavily references Conway’s Law, which states that organizations design systems that mirror their own communication structures. Team Topologies advises organizations to use this as a tool: “First, design the organization you want, and the system architecture will follow.” By creating small, autonomous, stream-aligned teams, you are intentionally designing your organization to produce a loosely coupled, modular software architecture.\nTeam-First Approach: The team is the fundamental unit of delivery. The model emphasizes creating long-lived, stable teams and giving them the autonomy and cognitive space to own their work and “build the right thing” and “build the thing right.”"

    "text": "P: How is ‘team cognitive load’ defined in the book?\nIn Team Topologies, ‘team cognitive load’ is defined as the total mental effort and capacity being used by a team at any given time to get their work done.\nThe authors, Manuel Pais and Matthew Skelton, adapt this concept from psychologist John Sweller’s Cognitive Load Theory. They argue that a team, just like an individual, has a finite mental capacity. If a team is responsible for too much, their performance plummets.\nThe book breaks this load down into three specific types:\n\nIntrinsic Cognitive Load: The “good” or necessary complexity related to the team’s core domain. For example, the effort required to understand the specific business rules of a payment processing system.\nExtraneous Cognitive Load: The “bad” or wasteful complexity. This is the mental effort spent on non-value-adding tasks, such as fighting with deployment tools, navigating complex environments, or trying to understand another team’s confusing API.\nGermane Cognitive Load: The “value-adding” complexity. This is the effort dedicated to learning, improving, and innovating within the core domain, such as discovering better ways to solve a business problem or improving the system’s architecture.\n\nThe central goal of the Team Topologies model is to minimize extraneous cognitive load (by using things like Platform teams) and keep the intrinsic load manageable. This frees up the team’s mental capacity for the germane load, which is where true innovation and “fast flow” happen."

They recognize the value of cross-functionality within the team, but reject the same idea for several teams working in the same product area.\nIf I were a business owner, I wish all my dev teams could pick up and do any kind of work. If they don’t know how, they can learn. And I am happy to pay for their “learning time”."

    "text": "Timeline\n\n1975: Born in Tomsk, USSR\n1978: Moved to Dubna, USSR; home to “Soviet CERN”\n1986: Got first computer, Yamaha MSX. Gaming and self-intro to programming in BASIC.\n1991: Moved to Geneva, CH (Jan 1991).\n1993: Enrolled at the University of Geneva, faculty of Science, Physics.  Working (evenings) at McDonald’s and doing private math tuition to earn some money.\n1995: Became interested in the “brain” and “complex systems”.  Part-time work at UniGE as a “monitor”, assistant to PhD students running physics labs. Wrote 1st non-trivial application to support “electrical components” lab (Windows 3.11, Delphi, C).\n1996: Summer job at the CERN’s Library. Started learning UNIX (Digital and SunOS) and shell scripting (ksh, tcsh) with Emacs. Created an HTML “app” for visual navigation of the library’s collection (with Mosaic browser). Discovered Linux (SlackWare and RedHat).\n1997: Obtained Licence ès sciences physiques (BSc). Final research project: “Study of doping effects by Fluorine on Bi(2212) high temperature superconductors in powder and mono-crystalline forms.”\n1998: Obtained Diplôme en physique (MSc). Thesis: “Motion correction in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging”.  Started using IDL and TeX/LaTeX.  Entered PhD program at the Group of Applied Physics under Prof. Pierre Descouts and Dr. François Lazeyras from the Dpt. of Radiology at HUG.\n Became sysadmin of all UNIX research workstations (DEC-Alpha, Sun Ultra). Introduced Linux as a cheaper and viable (able to run specialized software tools) alternative to commercial UNIX workstations (saved 15K CHF of public money allocated to my workstation). Discovered Python (v1.4) as a much better alternative to Perl and Shell for writing “glue” code (aka scripts).   In 1999, I managed to save a couple of weeks of MRI patient data that wasn’t backed up (time before PACS). The primary hard drive on the MRI console workstation has failed. I took the disk out, put into my Linux box, compiled a SCSI driver, mounted the drive and run fsck. Full data recovery.\n2003: Defended PhD thesis: “Epileptic Focus Localization Using EEG-triggered Functional MRI”. Continued work at the Dpt. of Radiology at HUG as a postdoctoral fellow. (thesis)\n During my PhD and later, I estimate that 60 to 70% of my time was spent on writing software; IDL for custom image processing, Matlab (because SPM, C for new MRI pulse sequences, Bash/Perl/Python for scripting. I’ve also built and administered a 3TB file server to store all our research data (RAID-0 with hot-swapable IDE discs using experimental 3ware controller) saving ~30kCHF of public money.   After my PhD defense, I continued as a postdoctoral fellow at HUG. My research focus shifted from clinical fMRI (presurgical evaluation for epilepsy and cancer patients) to fMRI activity localization (trying to improve Talairach/MNI coordinates). This work ended up on the cover image of NeuroImage.\n2004: Moved to Singapore to work at the National Neuroscience Institute as a postdoctoral fellow under Prof. Xavier Golay.  Our small (4 pax) research group did some amazing work on ASL, regional non-invasive perfusion and quantitative fMRI.\n2007: Moved to Tokyo, Japan. Joined Philips Healthcare, MRI clinical science team under Dr. Marc Van Cauteren. Joined Tokyo Linux Users Group. Co-founded Tokyo Hackerspace.\n2010: Moved back to Singapore. Quit Philips. 6 months sabbatical. Joined hackerspace.sg and Python User Group SG. Started helping organising PyCon-APAC/SG. Invited people like Wes McKinney (Pandas), Jacob Kaplan-Moss (Django), and Kenneth Reitz (Requests) to Singapore.\n2011: Got bitten by “startups bug”. Co-founded Ondelo (network services) and Teralogy/dacets (scientific data management, “git/github” for research data).\n2014: Joined Overseas Family School as education and technology research analyst.\n2016: Joined Odd-e. Started learning technical coaching (TDD/BDD, pair/mob programming, continuous integration,..). Joined the development team working on the LeSS site.\n2019: Full time embedded developer/technical coach/scrum master at Credit Suisse Singapore.  Developing Developers @ LeSS conf.\n2021-2022: Technical coach/scrum master at Huawei R&D center in Europe (remote).  LeSS friendly coach at Jago/DKatalis (hybrid).\n2025: Still with Odd-e and not planning to change. Mainly doing LeSS in Action trainings with Terry."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Here’s a structured breakdown of how using large language models (LLMs) for coding can influence code quality – both beneficial effects and risks – based on recent studies and empirical evidence.\n\n\nBefore diving in, it’s helpful to clarify what we mean by code quality. Common (but not exhaustive) dimensions include:\n\nFunctional correctness (the code does what it’s supposed to do)\nReadability / maintainability (clear structure, naming, documentation)\nReliability / robustness (handles edge cases, errors, unexpected inputs)\nPerformance / efficiency (reasonable resource use)\nSecurity / absence of vulnerabilities\nAdherence to architectural and style constraints / consistency\n\nAn LLM-based coding assist can affect each of these in different ways.\n\n\n\nHere are mechanisms by which LLMs (e.g. Copilot, Code Llama, ChatGPT, etc.) may enhance quality, along with supporting evidence.\n\nReducing boilerplate / mechanical errors\n\n\nLLMs excel at generating repetitive code patterns (e.g. CRUD routines, input validation, serialization). By automating mundane code scaffolding, they reduce opportunities for human typo or boilerplate mistakes, letting the human focus on logic and design.\nIn empirical experiments, Copilot-assisted developers had a 53.2% greater chance of passing all unit tests in a controlled task (versus those without it) — indicating an increase in functional correctness at least in that context. ￼\nSimilarly, GitHub’s internal “Quantifying Copilot” study found gains in readability, reliability, maintainability, and conciseness (though modest in magnitude) for Copilot-assisted code.\n\n\nImproving readability / consistency\n\n\nBecause LLMs have seen a vast corpus of code, they often generate code that follows common idioms and stylistic patterns. This can produce more consistent naming, formatting, and structural patterns.\nIn code review assessments from the Copilot experiments, code written with Copilot had fewer readability errors in blind review, on average.\nBeyond code generation, LLMs are also being used to revise code quality issues (e.g. take an input source and propose refactoring or fixes). For example, Microsoft’s “CORE” system uses a proposer + ranker LLM framework to suggest revisions based on static analysis outputs, thereby resolving code quality issues.\n\n\nFaster iteration, freeing cognitive bandwidth\n\n\nWith LLMs handling trivial or repetitive parts, developers can devote more attention to higher-level design, edge-case handling, and architecture — tasks that more strongly affect long-term code quality.\nGitHub’s Copilot telemetry/usage studies show that developers report lower mental fatigue, faster completion times, and happier workflows with Copilot assistance.\nIn enterprise settings (e.g. Accenture), adoption of Copilot corresponded with more pull requests and higher merge rates (which implies fewer blockers in code review) — suggesting that code written with AI help still met quality gates.\n\n\nDiscovering non-local patterns / detecting anti-patterns\n\n\nLLMs (especially large ones) can “see” across code context (within their context window) and suggest refactoring or warn about patterns that are not locally obvious (e.g. suggesting a shared helper, factoring duplicated logic, etc.).\nMore broadly, reviews of LLMs applied to source code highlight their strength in recognizing structural patterns and correlations that might escape a human glancing at only a few files.\n\n\nAugmenting or automating code review / linting / static-analysis\n\n\nLLMs are being integrated into code review pipelines, providing inline suggestions or catching issues before human review. This can reduce the backlog of simple review feedback and allow human reviewers to focus on architectural/semantic matters.\nThey are also used to generate or repair tests, suggest documentation, and enforce consistency constraints.\n\n\n\n\nWhile LLMs have promise, they are not magic, and can degrade quality (or induce new classes of defects) if used carelessly.\n\nCode smells and architectural debt\n\n\nThe latest work “Investigating the Smells of LLM Generated Code” (2025) finds that LLM-generated code exhibits substantially more code smells compared to human-written reference code. On average, the smell rate increased by ~63% (across various complexity levels).\nSmells include both implementation smells (e.g. duplicated logic, long methods) and design smells (e.g. poor modularization) — particularly in more complex tasks or advanced object-oriented designs.\nBecause LLMs are pattern-based, they may favor more “local” fixes rather than holistic refactoring. Over time, this can accumulate technical debt, lower consistency across modules, or hamper maintainability.\n\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities\n\n\nIn empirical audits, Security Weaknesses of Copilot-Generated Code in GitHub Projects found that a nontrivial portion of LLM-generated snippets contain security flaws. Specifically, 29.5% of Python and 24.2% of JavaScript snippets exhibited at least one weakness according to CWE metrics.\nCommon weakness classes included use of insufficient randomness, code injection, cross-site scripting, and improper control of generated code.\nOn the mitigation side, combining static analyzers with LLM-based fixes (via Copilot Chat prompts) could remediate up to ~55.5% of those flagged vulnerabilities in some experiments.\n\n\nOverconfidence, complacency, and human error propagation\n\n\nBecause the model seems “smart,” there is a risk developers might over-trust suggestions and insufficiently vet them, especially in less familiar domains or critical code (e.g. security, concurrency, performance-sensitive code).\nIn educational settings, a recent controlled study with undergraduates found that Copilot use can lead to over reliance and superficial understanding (i.e. students accept suggestions without fully reasoning about them).\nThe same study noted that while task completion time decreased, there were subtle regressions in learning and debugging skills.\n\n\nContext / domain mismatch, hallucinations, stale knowledge\n\n\nLLMs are trained on large corpora, but may not reflect your specific project’s architecture, domain logic, or constraints. A suggestion might violate invariants or assumptions not visible to the model.\nHallucinated code (i.e. syntactically plausible but semantically incorrect) is still a well-known risk.\nFor domain-specific or cutting-edge code (e.g. new libraries, novel algorithms), the LLM’s training may not fully cover the space, leading to weak suggestions or misleading completions.\n\n\nFragmentation / consistency drift\n\n\nOver time, different parts of the codebase might get generated or touched with different “flavors” of LLM suggestions, introducing inconsistent patterns, naming conventions, or architectural styles, unless there is strict oversight and linting.\nSome developers report that LLMs are weaker at refactoring and maintaining cohesive architecture in large codebases. “LLMs make it easy to write code, but aren’t as good at refactoring and maintaining a cohesive architecture.”\n\n\nDownward pressure on quality in large codebases\n\n\nSome commentary and analyses (e.g. “Downward Pressure on Code Quality” articles) warn that faster coding enabled by LLMs might tempt teams to accept more “quick and dirty” changes, deferring refactoring and increasing technical debt over time.\nThese arguments are more cautionary than definitive; the effect likely depends on team discipline, reviews, and development culture.\n\n\nEffect on maintainers / on-boarding / future edits\n\n\nIf generated code is opaque or non‐idiomatic, future maintainers may struggle to understand, debug, or extend it — especially if the LLM suggestion lacks comments, rationale, or clear logic.\nThe “explainability” of LLM output is limited; often not accompanied by reasoning or formal guarantees, making review more difficult.\n\n\n\n\nGiven the dual nature of benefits and risks, the net effect of LLM use on code quality depends heavily on how it’s integrated into the development process. Some key moderating factors:\n\nDeveloper skill and domain knowledge\n\n\nStrong developers are more capable of vetting, refining, and adapting LLM suggestions; they can correct mistakes or steer the model. Novice users may blindly accept suboptimal output.\nFor well-known patterns, LLMs can be very helpful; for novel or domain-specific components, human insight is still critical.\n\n\nReview / quality gates\n\n\nRigorous code review, static analysis, testing, and security audits must remain — LLM usage should not replace these quality safeguards, but augment them.\nA good strategy is to treat LLM-generated code as a first draft to be improved, rather than a final deliverable.\n\n\nPrompt design / context provision\n\n\nBetter prompts (with overviews, constraints, tests, style guides) lead to better suggestions. The LLM must “know” your expectations and context.\nWhere possible, giving the model feedback (e.g. “fix this,” “make this more modular,” etc.) can steer it toward higher-quality code.\n\n\nIncremental adoption and monitoring\n\n\nGradual adoption lets teams monitor metrics (defects, review comments, churn, security bugs) and detect regressions early.\nSome organizations perform their own A/B or causal analyses to isolate the effect of the LLM on quality (as seen in Faros’ analysis of Copilot usage).\n\n\nSpecialization & dividing tasks\n\n\nUse LLMs for tasks where they shine (scaffolding, boilerplate, test generation, simple functions) while retaining human control over architecture, core business logic, security/critical paths, and system integration.\n\n\nContinuous improvement / retraining\n\n\nCapturing patterns of accepted suggestions, feedback loops (i.e. learning from corrections), and internal fine-tuning can improve future suggestions to better align with project style and domain constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\nNet effect is neither guaranteed positive nor negative — using LLMs can improve code quality (especially in functional correctness, readability, and iteration speed) if used thoughtfully, but also introduces additional risk vectors (smells, security flaws, architectural drift, over reliance).\nEmpirical and controlled studies suggest modest but statistically significant improvements in many quality dimensions for LLM-assisted coding under experimental conditions. ￼\nBut emerging research (e.g. on code smells) is raising caution flags about the quality of generated code, particularly in complex scenarios.\nThe key is governance: strong review processes, prompt engineering, domain expertise, and monitoring are essential to ensuring LLM use leads to net quality gains."

    "section": "P: Do you know the story behind the product called WD-40?",
    "text": "P: Do you know the story behind the product called WD-40?\nThe story of WD-40 is a classic example of persistence and accidental success. It wasn’t originally designed for squeaky doors or stuck zippers; it was invented for rocket science\nHere is the breakdown of how “Water Displacement, 40th Formula” came to be.\n\n1. The Original Purpose: Protecting Missiles\nIn 1953, a small company called the Rocket Chemical Company in San Diego, California, set out to create a line of rust-prevention solvents and degreasers for the aerospace industry.\nTheir specific goal was to create a formula that would displace water to prevent corrosion on the outer skin of the Atlas Missile (the first operational intercontinental ballistic missile developed for the U.S. Air Force). The missile’s stainless steel skin was so thin that it was actually kept rigid by the pressure of the fuel inside; if it rusted or corroded, it could be catastrophic.\n\n\n2. The Name: Why “40”?\nThe name is surprisingly literal. It stands for “Water Displacement, 40th Formula.”\nThe chemists at the company (often credited to Norm Larsen, though some sources cite chemist Iver Norman Lawson) worked through 39 failed formulas. They were trying to find a chemical balance that would effectively displace standing water and prevent moisture from forming.\nOn their 40th attempt, they finally got the mixture right. That is the exact formula still in use today.\n\n\n3. From Rockets to Household Shelves\nThe transition from industrial aerospace product to household staple happened organically:\n\nThe “Sneak” Phase: The product worked so well at the plant that employees started sneaking cans of it home in their lunchboxes to use on their own cars, tools, and squeaky appliances.\nThe Pivot: Noticing this unauthorized personal use, Norm Larsen realized the commercial potential. In 1958, the company began putting the fluid into aerosol cans and selling it to the general public in San Diego.\nThe Big Break: In 1961, a massive storm called Hurricane Carla struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. The company received its first truckload order to ship WD-40 to the victims, who used it to recondition flood-damaged vehicles and equipment. This proved its utility on a massive scale.\n\n\n\n4. Interesting Facts\nThe Secret Sauce: The formula is a trade secret and was never patented. This was a strategic move; patents require you to publicly disclose your ingredients, and patents eventually expire. By keeping it a trade secret, the company never had to reveal exactly what is in the can.\nNot a Lubricant? Technically, WD-40 is a solvent and a water displacer, not a primary lubricant. While it helps things move by cleaning them and unsticking them, it eventually evaporates. (For long-term lubrication, you are often better off with silicone or grease).\nThe Company Name: The Rocket Chemical Company was so successful with this one product that they eventually just renamed the entire company. In 1969, they officially became the WD-40 Company."

    "text": "What is Bionic Reading?\nDefinition & mechanism\n- Bionic Reading was developed by Swiss designer Renato Casutt. According to his website, the idea is to “make reading easier by guiding the eyes through artificial fixation points”. (howtogeek.com)\n- In practice: parts of words (typically the first few letters) are bolded (or otherwise visually highlighted). The idea is that the reader’s eye jumps (“saccades”) from one bolded section (“fixation point”) to the next, and the brain fills in the remainder of each word. (triangle.indwes.edu)\n- Additional parameters: the method’s website refers to three components—Fixation, Saccade, and Opacity—which allow adjustments (how many letters are bolded, how visible the non‑bold text is, column width, etc.). (bionic-reading.com)\n- It is marketed as a tool for reading speed, reading focus (especially for those with attentional issues), and improved comprehension/retention. For example the official site claims benefits such as “Save precious time. Gain advantages. Learn new things faster.” (bionic-reading.com)\nPractical usage\n- Apps or browser extensions exist to convert regular text (PDF, EPUB, web pages) into Bionic Reading format. (howtogeek.com)\n- Users report that for them the bolded‑first‑letters help them focus and “skim” more easily, though this is anecdotal. (See for instance Reddit commentary.) (reddit.com)"

    "text": "What does the scientific evidence say?\nSince you have a scientific background, I’ll divide into (A) rigorous experimental/empirical studies, and (B) smaller scale educational/qualitative studies, followed by my commentary.\n\nA. Rigorous empirical studies\n\nA peer‑reviewed article listed on PubMed:\nTitle: “No, Bionic Reading does not work” (Elsevier, 2024) – statistical analyses for 100 paragraphs comparing Bionic vs normal reading found no significant difference in reading times. (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)\nThe authors conclude: “I conclude that Bionic Reading does not facilitate reading.” (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)\n\nAn EEG master’s thesis: “An EEG Study on The Effect of Bionic Reading on Semantic Processing” (student thesis at Utrecht University) – this suggests an attempt to measure neural/semantic processing of Bionic Reading, but being a thesis (not full peer‑reviewed yet) limits its weight. (studenttheses.uu.nl)\n\nThus from the highest standard evidence so far: no robust effect on speed/efficiency in normal reading tasks.\n\n\nB. Educational/qualitative studies\n\nA quasi‑experimental study of 110 learners with learning disabilities in the Philippines (2022‑23) found that Bionic Reading improved reading motivation and self‑efficacy significantly for the experimental group (versus control) in post‑intervention tests. (ijams-bbp.net)\n\nA classroom action research study (30 10th‑grade students, Indonesia) found average reading scores improved from 67 → 72 and % of students meeting a “minimum mastery criterion” increased from 63% → 75% using a “Bionic method”. (bajangjournal.com)\n\nSome blog/educator commentary analyses are skeptical. For example, one article discusses five key questions and essentially points out that rigorous empirical evidence is lacking. (languageeducatorsassemble.com)\n\n\n\nC. Summary of evidence\n\nReading speed/comprehension (normal adult readers): empirically no convincing benefit (per Elsevier study)\n\nMotivation/self‑efficacy (learners with disabilities): some positive preliminary results\n\nOverall: the method is not yet strongly validated in robust cognitive/behavioral studies."

    "section": "Critical commentary (given your background)",
    "text": "Critical commentary (given your background)\nFrom a cognitive/neurological perspective:\n\nReading involves a complex interplay of bottom‑up (orthographic/phonological/lexical) processing and top‑down (semantic/contextual) processing. The “visual word form area”, saccadic eye‑movements, fixation durations, etc., all matter. For instance, research shows that altering text layout can affect oculomotor behaviour (see e.g., inverted/mirrored text reading) but tends to slow reading rather than speed it. (arxiv.org)\n\nThe claim of “brain fills in the rest of each word” relies on the assumption that readers consistently use a chunking strategy of few letters + context. While partial word recognition is plausible (there’s evidence for parafoveal processing, etc.), constructing artificial bolded fixation points presumes that you can systematically reduce fixations without increasing processing cost elsewhere (e.g., reconstructing the word, losing some letters, etc.).\n\nThe empirical null result (no significant difference in reading time) aligns with the expectation that any alteration in text format that changes typical fixations/saccades may disrupt rather than enhance reading in skilled readers.\n\nThe positive results in motivation/self‑efficacy settings (learners with disabilities) might reflect meta-cognitive/affective benefits (i.e., the novelty or perceived “helpful” formatting leads to increased engagement) rather than a true cognitive/processing speed increase.\n\nBecause you work in brain imaging, it is worth noting that I found no published neuroimaging study (fMRI/EEG) at large scale showing altered activation patterns or reading‑network efficiency changes due to Bionic Reading. The EEG thesis suggests someone is attempting that, but results don’t appear peer‑reviewed yet.\n\nSpeed‑reading claims (especially big ones) are generally treated with scepticism in reading‑science (see for example reviews of speed‑reading techniques).

    "text": "My conclusion\n\nAt this point, the method is interesting, and the user‑reports (especially for dyslexia/attention issues) suggest that there may be some subjective benefit (engagement, focus).\n\nHowever, if the question is “Does Bionic Reading improve reading speed/comprehension in adult readers under controlled conditions?” — the answer is: no strong evidence yet.\n\nIf you are considering either (a) recommending it for your own reading workflows, or (b) studying it as part of cognitive/neuroscience research, the key caveats are:\n\nIt may not help (and might even slow) skilled readers.\n\nFor reading‑disability populations the affective/motivational benefits might be worthwhile to explore further.\n\nIf you’re considering research: designing an eye‑tracking + EEG/fMRI study comparing normal vs bolded‑format reading (with conditions controlling for word‑length, frequency, fixation/saccade patterns) would be valuable.\n\nThe metric of “reading speed” should be carefully defined (words per minute, fixation count, saccade length) and “comprehension” needs to be tested with valid comprehension tasks, not just subject ratings."

Research uses simulation optimization, multi-objective/meta-heuristics, and RL to beat hand-tuned heuristics—mostly on larger groups (e.g., 4+ cars, 15–40 floors).\nDestination-dispatch assignment itself is a nontrivial combinatorial routing/assignment problem with time-dependent costs and constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraffic modes: up-peak, inter-floor, down-peak, off-peak; switch weights (w_wait, w_incar, w_dir) by mode (time-of-day + simple real-time triggers). ￼\nCosted ETA assignment with 1–2 stop look-ahead, door-open/close timing and jerk-limited motion model.\nAnti-bunching & parking: mild penalties when cars are close; when idle, park cars at strategic “home” floors (e.g., 3 and 8).\nFairness: cap maximum predicted wait; if exceeded, allow “stealing” across zones.\nDiagnostics: log predicted vs. actual waits/ride times to tune weights.\n(Optional) DCS kiosk prototype for peak-hour batching if your building can accept it.\n\n\n\n\n\nReinforcement learning: Crites & Barto showed RL can beat strong heuristics in simulation; modern variants continue to appear (but require careful state design and simulators).\nMulti-objective optimization: explicitly balance average/percentile wait, ride time, and energy; evolutionary/submodular approaches exist."

    "text": "1. Eroticism and Loneliness\nEvolutionary biology, genetically programmed for reproduction, pleasures of sex as a reward for undertaking the immense efforts of raising children\nBut evolutionary biology doesn’t really provide us with a very satisfactory account of why sex should really matter to us as reflexive humans.\nMemories of first or new encounter with someone exhibiting reciprocal interest, first kiss… Relation to child-mother, unconditional acceptance, tenderness and love with a lot of physical contact. Gradually there is a separation, covering of the body, adolescence, social and cultural norms, public and private self, shame.\n\nWe grow into clumsy, heavy-footed, shameful, anxious creatures. We become adults, definitively expelled from paradise. But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we are, without regard to our deeds; to be loved through the medium of our body; to be enclosed in another’s arms.\n\n\nThe Kiss – Acceptance\n\nIt could sound disgusting, and that’s the point. Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting, which is precisely what makes erotic moments so intense.\n\n\n\nThe Undressing – An end to shame\n\nThe shame begins in adolescence… A division begins between our ordinary public selves on the one hand and our sexual and private identities on the other. A large portion of who we are as adults, from our sexual fantasies to our parted legs, becomes impossible to share with almost anyone we know.\n\nsexual fantasies clash with what we think is proper and expected behavior (from family and society).\n\n\nExcitement – Authenticity\n\nErections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest.\n\n\n\nRudeness – Love\n\nIt can be a sign of love to be allowed to slap someone hard across the face or to clasp our hands forcefully around another’s neck… It doesn’t matter to them (partner) that we have darker sides; they can – like the ideal parent – see us whole and recognize us as being fundamentally good.\n\n\nWhen we are on the receiving end of this type of violence and rudeness, we may find a parallel pleasure, and a certain sense of strength, in being able to decide for ourselves just how insulted, hurt and dominated we are going to feel.\n\n\n\nFetishism – Goodness\n\nWe will be drawn to specific things either because they recall appealing qualities of a beloved parental figure or else, conversely, because they somehow cancel out, or otherwise help us to escape, a memory of early humiliation or terror.\n\nDeep, semi-conscious memories that might indicate/confirm an ideal partner.\n\nThey turn us on because they are emblems of the Good.\n\n\n\nOrgasm – Utopia\n\nThe more closely we analyze what we consider “sexy”, the more clearly we will understand that eroticism is the feeling of excitement we experience at finding another human being who shares our values and our sense of the meaning of existence.\n\n\nThe orgasm itself marks the supreme moment when our loneliness and alienation are momentarily overcome. Everything we have appreciated about our lover […] are combined into a concentrated distillation of pleasure that leaves each partner feeling uniquely tender towards and vulnerable with the other.\n\n\nPost-coital sadness often settles over a couple.\n\n\n…it [sex] is an ecstasy we feel at encountering someone who may be able to put to rest certain of our greatest fears, and with whom we may hope to build a shared life based upon common values."

Duration of REM phase increases during later cycles.\nRemoving (pruning) of unnecessairy neural connections during the NREM, strengthening existing connections during REM. During REM, brain activity is very close to awake state (fast, no sync between regions). During NREM there are slow syncronized waves. Loss of consciousness and the sense of time during sleep is because of inhibition of sensory information flow through thalamus during sleep.\nDuring NREM we transfer memories from short term to long term storage (reason why we need syncronization across regions).\nDreaming during REM is probably like a replay and check of memories after they have been modified during NREM phase. During REM phase the body is completely paralyzed (except for involuntary movement like breathing) again through thalamus to avoid motor activity due to dreaming (evolutionary, avoid dropping from trees while sleeping)."

All image layers are RO. A contaier runs in a special RW container layer which gets destroyed when container is stoped. Data can be persisted in named volumes inside /var/lib/docker/volumes (volume mount) or a directory on a host (bind mount).\ndocker volume create my_volume\ndocker run -v my_volume:/var/log my_image\n\n# new explicit format for mounting volumes\ndocker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/my_image/logs,target=/var/log my_image\n\n\nRemoving images\ndocker images\ndocker rmi &lt;image_id1&gt; &lt;image_id2&gt;\ndocker system prune -a\ndocker volume ls\ndocker volume rm &lt;volume_name1&gt; &lt;volume_name2&gt;\n\n\nDocker compose\nIt’s possible to run multiple containers and “link” them for networking.

Instead of combinatorial sum, use a combination of binary AND and OR when combining chunks.\nSimple enough for an algorithmic problem. Skills to practice: splitting the problems into smaller problems, naming things, simplify by extraction, refactoring while in green, make it work first.\nPractical application: Luhn algorithm."
