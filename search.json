Sit in a comfortable pose that allows to be both relaxed and alert. Bring attention to the process of breathing. If the mind gets distracted by a sound, or an itch, acknowledge the source of distraction, experience it without judging, and let it go if it wants to be let go.

Suggested topics: “what are you feeling right now?”, “what is something that happened today that you want to talk about?”, “anything you want to talk about?”\nOur attention is the most valuable gift we can give to others.\nMindful conversation: mindful listening, looping (listener tells the speaker what he or she heard), dipping (self-checkin). How to listen and do self-checkin at the same time? Central vision (attention on other) and peripheral vision (attention on self).\nTips for practicing mindfulness: 1) Have a buddy, 2) do less than you can(one mindful breath a day), 3) self-checkin (how am i doing with my commitment to my practice, what has arisen in my life that relates to my practice)\nphysical fitness: strength and stamina (circuit interval training, cardio, resistance) attention: focused (intense focus on a chosen object) and open attention (willingness to meet any object that arrives in the mind)\nMeditation circuit training: rest the mind, 3 min of focused attention, 3 min of open attention.\nZen and a baby learning to walk.

Narcissists demand this right, then refuse to allow other points of view on the grounds that any other opinion somehow infringes their freedom of speech or is offensive.\n\n\nEveryone is an idiot from time to time.\n\n\n\nFirst Law\n(three circles and flowers)\n\nAfter my yarns with Percy, I begin to see the uncertainty principle not as a law but as an expression of frustration about the impossibility of achieving godlike scientific objectivity.\n\n\n\nForever limited\n\nSustainable systems cannot be manufactured by individuals or appointed committees, particularly during times of intense transition and upheaval.\n\n\nIdeas can be re-engineered to serve the interests of the powerful.\n\n(chekout Larry Gross, Post Apocaliptic Stress Syndrom).\n\n\nLines in the sand\n\nPeople today will mostly focus on the points of connection, the nodes of interest like stars in the sky. But the real understanding comes in the spaces in between, in the relational forces that connect and move the points.\n\n\nSystems are heterarchical – composed of equal parts interacting together. Imposing a hierarchical model of top-down control can only destroy them. Healthy interventions can only be made by free agents within a complex system.\n\n\nOn learning another culture (cultural humility): 1) Check your ego and motives, 2) You don’t need to be an expert to understand the knowledge process of people from other cultures and enter into dialogues with them (but you need to show respect), 3) Making yourself an expert in another culture is not always appreciated by the members of that culture.\n\n\nIt is difficult to relinquish the illusions of power and delusions of exceptionalism that come with privilege. But it is strangely liberating to realise your true status as a single node in a cooperative network.\n\n\nSustainable systems cannot function without the full autonomy and unique expression of each independent part of the interdependent whole.\n\n\nSustainability agents have a few simple operating guidelines, or network protocols, or rules if you like – connect, diversify, interact and adapt.\n\n\nAn agent that is truly adaptive and changing is open to sudden eruptions of transformation.\n\n\nNot all strange attractors are benevolent (narcissist).\n\n\nAdolescent cultures always ask the same three questions. Why are we here? How should we live? What will happen when we die?\n\n\n\nOf Spirit and Spirits\n\nThere are at least four parts to your spirit from an Aboriginal point of view: your higher self (superego), ancestral spirit, living spirit and shadow spirit… Your shadow spirit is that part of you that wants things you don’t need, makes you think you’re better than other people and above the land. If the rest of your spirit is not clear and in balance, it gets away from you, causing conflict and destruction. You gossip behind people’s backs, spread uncertainty, deliver judgments, upset people, take more than you need and accumulate goods without sharing. It makes you a competitor instead of a human being.\n\n                   =     metaphors   \n                //   \\\\    \nabstract       o      o   concrete\n                \\\\   //\n                   =    metaphors\n\nThere is a spark of creation like lightning when true learning takes place, with a genetic reward of chemical pleasure released in the brain… The chemical burst of pleasure we feel when genuine knowledge transmission takes place occurs from the creation of new neural pathways. These are connections between two points that were previously unconnected. Jokes are one of the most pure examples of this neural creation event… If people are laughing, they are learning.\n\n\nThere needs to be an interaction between abstract (spirit) and concrete (physical) worlds of knowledge for this kind of complexity to develop fully.\n\n\nWithout closing the loop between abstract knowledge and reality, and without making connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge, true learning cannot occur.\n\n\nA focus on linear, abstract, declarative knowledge alone not only fails to create complex connectivity but damages the mind. We are biologically punished for this destructive behaviour with a neuro-chemical rush of lethargy and discomfort that most people call boredom.\n\n\nKnowledge transmission must connect both abstract knowledge and concrete application through meaningful metaphors to be effective.\n\n\n\nAdvanced and Fair\nTODO",

I don’t remember when the term “resource” applied to people started to bother me. It’s been a while, but usually I didn’t do anything about it. Last year I decided to engage with an HR admin in a bank where I worked as an external consultant. She kept referring to me and my colleagues as “external resources” in emails. I’d asked her to stop calling us that, but either she had ignored my request or thought it wasn’t important and continued to call us “ER”s. I repeated my request accompanied by a small explanation why people are not resources thinking that sensible people especially working in HR would have no problem understanding it. Her reply: “but it is just a classification in our internal IT system”…\nSome of my HR friends say that the R-word is slowly disappearing from their industry’s lexicon and that organization adopt Google’s “People Operation” or similar (hopefully not just borrowing the term and being done with it). I like this development.\nWhat about “talent”? It is not as offensive as “resources”, but still might trigger “I’ve got no talents.” Or “I’m not good at this.” And isn’t talent overrated? And what about “human capital” or “human assets”? What is the benefit of using these words and constructs instead of just “people”?",

    "text": "1. Eroticism and Loneliness\nEvolutionary biology, genetically programmed for reproduction, pleasures of sex as a reward for undertaking the immense efforts of raising children\nBut evolutionary biology doesn’t really provide us with a very satisfactory account of why sex should really matter to us as reflexive humans.\nMemories of first or new encounter with someone exhibiting reciprocal interest, first kiss… Relation to child-mother, unconditional acceptance, tenderness and love with a lot of physical contact. Gradually there is a separation, covering of the body, adolescence, social and cultural norms, public and private self, shame.\n\nWe grow into clumsy, heavy-footed, shameful, anxious creatures. We become adults, definitively expelled from paradise. But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we are, without regard to our deeds; to be loved through the medium of our body; to be enclosed in another’s arms.\n\n\nThe Kiss – Acceptance\n\nIt could sound disgusting, and that’s the point. Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting, which is precisely what makes erotic moments so intense.\n\n\n\nThe Undressing – An end to shame\n\nThe shame begins in adolescence… A division begins between our ordinary public selves on the one hand and our sexual and private identities on the other. A large portion of who we are as adults, from our sexual fantasies to our parted legs, becomes impossible to share with almost anyone we know.\n\nsexual fantasies clash with what we think is proper and expected behavior (from family and society).\n\n\nExcitement – Authenticity\n\nErections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest.\n\n\n\nRudeness – Love\n\nIt can be a sign of love to be allowed to slap someone hard across the face or to clasp our hands forcefully around another’s neck… It doesn’t matter to them (partner) that we have darker sides; they can – like the ideal parent – see us whole and recognize us as being fundamentally good.\n\n\nWhen we are on the receiving end of this type of violence and rudeness, we may find a parallel pleasure, and a certain sense of strength, in being able to decide for ourselves just how insulted, hurt and dominated we are going to feel.\n\n\n\nFetishism – Goodness\n\nWe will be drawn to specific things either because they recall appealing qualities of a beloved parental figure or else, conversely, because they somehow cancel out, or otherwise help us to escape, a memory of early humiliation or terror.\n\nDeep, semi-conscious memories that might indicate/confirm an ideal partner.\n\nThey turn us on because they are emblems of the Good.\n\n\n\nOrgasm – Utopia\n\nThe more closely we analyze what we consider “sexy”, the more clearly we will understand that eroticism is the feeling of excitement we experience at finding another human being who shares our values and our sense of the meaning of existence.\n\n\nThe orgasm itself marks the supreme moment when our loneliness and alienation are momentarily overcome. Everything we have appreciated about our lover […] are combined into a concentrated distillation of pleasure that leaves each partner feeling uniquely tender towards and vulnerable with the other.\n\n\nPost-coital sadness often settles over a couple.\n\n\n…it [sex] is an ecstasy we feel at encountering someone who may be able to put to rest certain of our greatest fears, and with whom we may hope to build a shared life based upon common values.",
