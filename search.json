Sit in a comfortable pose that allows to be both relaxed and alert. Bring attention to the process of breathing. If the mind gets distracted by a sound, or an itch, acknowledge the source of distraction, experience it without judging, and let it go if it wants to be let go. If you need to move, maintain mindfulness of intention, movement and sensation. If self-criticism or self-judgment arises, invite a thought of self-directed kindness to arise.",

Office to restroom.\nMindful listening exercise (10 min): speaker-listener pair, 3 minutes monologue, listener gives full attention to the speaker, no questions allowed, only “I see” or “I understand”, give space to silence. Switch roles. Have a meta-conversation at the end. Suggested topics: “what are you feeling right now?”, “what is something that happened today that you want to talk about?”, “anything you want to talk about?”\nOur attention is the most valuable gift we can give to others.\nMindful conversation: mindful listening, looping (listener tells the speaker what he or she heard), dipping (self-checkin).

Central vision (attention on other) and peripheral vision (attention on self).\nTips for practicing mindfulness: 1) Have a buddy, 2) do less than you can(one mindful breath a day), 3) self-checkin (how am i doing with my commitment to my practice, what has arisen in my life that relates to my practice)\nphysical fitness: strength and stamina (circuit interval training, cardio, resistance) attention: focused (intense focus on a chosen object) and open attention (willingness to meet any object that arrives in the mind)\nMeditation circuit training: rest the mind, 3 min of focused attention, 3 min of open attention.\nZen and a baby learning to walk.

    "text": "1. Eroticism and Loneliness\nEvolutionary biology, genetically programmed for reproduction, pleasures of sex as a reward for undertaking the immense efforts of raising children\nBut evolutionary biology doesn’t really provide us with a very satisfactory account of why sex should really matter to us as reflexive humans.\nMemories of first or new encounter with someone exhibiting reciprocal interest, first kiss… Relation to child-mother, unconditional acceptance, tenderness and love with a lot of physical contact. Gradually there is a separation, covering of the body, adolescence, social and cultural norms, public and private self, shame.\n\nWe grow into clumsy, heavy-footed, shameful, anxious creatures. We become adults, definitively expelled from paradise. But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we are, without regard to our deeds; to be loved through the medium of our body; to be enclosed in another’s arms.\n\n\nThe Kiss – Acceptance\n\nIt could sound disgusting, and that’s the point. Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting, which is precisely what makes erotic moments so intense.\n\n\n\nThe Undressing – An end to shame\n\nThe shame begins in adolescence… A division begins between our ordinary public selves on the one hand and our sexual and private identities on the other. A large portion of who we are as adults, from our sexual fantasies to our parted legs, becomes impossible to share with almost anyone we know.\n\nsexual fantasies clash with what we think is proper and expected behavior (from family and society).\n\n\nExcitement – Authenticity\n\nErections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest.\n\n\n\nRudeness – Love\n\nIt can be a sign of love to be allowed to slap someone hard across the face or to clasp our hands forcefully around another’s neck… It doesn’t matter to them (partner) that we have darker sides; they can – like the ideal parent – see us whole and recognize us as being fundamentally good.\n\n\nWhen we are on the receiving end of this type of violence and rudeness, we may find a parallel pleasure, and a certain sense of strength, in being able to decide for ourselves just how insulted, hurt and dominated we are going to feel.\n\n\n\nFetishism – Goodness\n\nWe will be drawn to specific things either because they recall appealing qualities of a beloved parental figure or else, conversely, because they somehow cancel out, or otherwise help us to escape, a memory of early humiliation or terror.\n\nDeep, semi-conscious memories that might indicate/confirm an ideal partner.\n\nThey turn us on because they are emblems of the Good.\n\n\n\nOrgasm – Utopia\n\nThe more closely we analyze what we consider “sexy”, the more clearly we will understand that eroticism is the feeling of excitement we experience at finding another human being who shares our values and our sense of the meaning of existence.\n\n\nThe orgasm itself marks the supreme moment when our loneliness and alienation are momentarily overcome. Everything we have appreciated about our lover […] are combined into a concentrated distillation of pleasure that leaves each partner feeling uniquely tender towards and vulnerable with the other.\n\n\nPost-coital sadness often settles over a couple.\n\n\n…it [sex] is an ecstasy we feel at encountering someone who may be able to put to rest certain of our greatest fears, and with whom we may hope to build a shared life based upon common values.",

Gaming and self-intro to programming in BASIC.\n1991: Moved to Geneva, CH (Jan 1991).\n1993: Enrolled at the University of Geneva, faculty of Science, Physics.\n1995: Became interested in “brain” and “complex systems”.  Part-time work at UniGE as a “monitor”, assistant to PhD students running physics labs. Wrote 1st non-trivial application to support “electrical components” lab (Windows 3.11, Delphi, C).\n1996: Summer job at the CERN’s Library. Started learning UNIX (Digital and SunOS) and shell scripting (ksh, tcsh) with Emacs. Created an HTML “app” for visual navigation of the library’s collection (with Mosaic browser).\n1997: Obtained Licence ès sciences physiques (BSc). Final research project: “Study of doping effects by Fluorine on Bi(2212) high temperature superconductors in powder and mono-crystalline forms.”\n1998: Obtained Diplôme en physique (MSc). Thesis: “Motion correction in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging”.  Started using IDL and TeX/LaTeX.  Entered PhD program at the Group of Applied Physics under Prof. Pierre Descouts and Dr. François Lazeyras from the Dpt. of Radiology at HUG.\n Became sysadmin of all UNIX research workstations (DEC-Alpha, Sun Ultra). Introduced Linux as a cheaper and viable (able to run specialized software tools) alternative to commercial UNIX workstations.\n2003: Defended PhD thesis: “Epileptic Focus Localization Using EEG-triggered Functional MRI”. Continued work at the Dpt. of Radiology at HUG as a postdoctoral fellow.\n During my PhD and later, I estimate that 60 to 70% of my time was spent on writing software; IDL for image processing, C for new MRI pulse sequences, bash/perl/python for scripting. I’ve also built and administered a 3TB file server to store all our research data (RAID-0 with hot-swapable IDE discs using experimental 3ware controller) saving ~30kCHF of public money.\n2004: Moved to Singapore to work at the National Neuroscience Institute as a postdoctoral fellow under Prof. Xavier Golay.\n2007: Moved to Tokyo, Japan. Joined Philips Healthcare, MRI clinical science team. Joined Tokyo Linux Users Group. Co-founded Tokyo Hackerspace.\n2010: Moved back to Singapore. Quit Philips. 6 months sabbatical. Joined hackerspace.SG and Python User Group SG.\n2011: Got bitten by “startups bug”. Co-founded Ondelo (network services) and Teralogy/dacets (scientific data management, “git/github” for research data).\n2014: Joined Overseas Family School as education and technology research analyst.\n2016: Joined Odd-e.",

Certifications like ISO 9001 are useful for getting contractual agreements. There are also more subtle signals. For example B-corp certification means that a for-profit organization puts social sustainability above profit, while worldblue membership signals a cultural shift from traditional command-and-control to a more progressive organization.\nBut there are also organizations that don’t bother with certifications and branding. They just focus on doing good work and leave signalling to word-of-mouth. Corporate Rebels and their bucketlist are currently the best source of information on such organizations.

    "text": "language and the words you use say a lot about a culture, and that we can take steps to change culture through changing those words. – Emily Webber\n\nThe above quote is from a short and sweet “Should you call people resources?” post which resonated with me. I don’t remember when the term “resource” applied to people started to bother me. It’s been a while, but usually I didn’t do anything about it. Last year I decided to engage with an HR admin in a bank where I worked as an external consultant. She kept referring to me and my colleagues as “external resources” in emails. I’d asked her to stop calling us that, but either she had ignored my request or thought it wasn’t important and continued to call us “ER”s. I repeated my request accompanied by a small explanation why people are not resources thinking that sensible people especially working in HR would have no problem understanding it. Her reply: “but it is just a classification in our internal IT system”…\nSome of my HR friends say that the R-word is slowly disappearing from their industry’s lexicon and that organization adopt Google’s “People Operation” or similar (hopefully not just borrowing the term and being done with it). I like this development.\nWhat about “talent”? It is not as offensive as “resources”, but still might trigger “I’ve got no talents.” Or “I’m not good at this.” And isn’t talent overrated? And what about “human capital” or “human assets”? What is the benefit of using these words and constructs instead of just “people”?",

    "text": "Why managers exist? Why org structures exist?\nHow does a bad org structure look like? Rank (position in a hierarchy) is used as a tool of oppression. Information hoarding, playing dominance games (politics). Decisions are made based on rank.\nHierarchy is a property of self-organizing systems.\n\nA system is “a network of interdependent components that work together to try to accomplish a common aim.” – W. Edward Deming.\n\nA subsystem is a collection of elements with a smaller aim inside a larger system. The sybsystems always work to support the needs of the larger system; if the sybsystem instead optimizes for its own best interest, the whole system can fail.\nA system is self-organizing if it has the ability to make itself more complex, by diversifying, adapting, and improving itself. As systems self-organize and their complexity increases, they tend to generate hierarchy – an arrangement of systems and subsystems. In a stable, resilient and efficient system, sybsystems can largely take care of themselves, regulate themselves, and serve the needs of the larger system, while the larger system coordinates between subsystems and helps them perform better. Hierarchy minimizes the costs of coordination and reduces the amount of information that any given part of the system has to keep track of, preventing information overload. Information transfer and relationships withing a sybsystem are more more dense and have fewer delays than information transfer or relationshions between subsystems.\nA manager’s job is to coordinate between teams and help their team perform better.\nSoftware product development organizations are socio-technical systems, but the separation between “socio/people” and “technical/engineering” is never clean. Need for “glue work”.\nTasks that need to be done by any functional engineering org besides writing code:\n\nRecruiting: networking, interviewing, writing job descriptions and career ladders.\nProject management: managing stakeholders, prioritizing backlog, estimating size and scope.\nRunning team meetings: 1x1s (growth feedback), retrospectives, writing reviews, representing the teams’s needs.\nArchitecture, code reviews, capturing DORA and productivity metrics, managing burnout.",

    "section": "Engineering managers are a useful abstraction.",
    "text": "Engineering managers are a useful abstraction.\nOne of the primary benefits of hierarchy is to reduce information overload. Engineering labor takes concentration and focus. Context switching is expensive. Management labor consist of context switching every hour or so, and being available for interruptions throughtout the day. Engineering calendar and management calendar do not coexist well.\nIt isn’t up to managers to do all the glue work, but it is a manager’s job to make sure that everything that needs to get done, does gets done (requires providing necessary resources to people who do the actual work).\nAn engineer is responsible for the software she develops, deploys, and maintains. A manager is responsible for her team and the organization as a whole.\nIn natural hierarchies, we look up for purpose and down for function. The above makes a complicated argument for why we need engineering managers.\nThe simpler argument is that most engineering orgs have engineering managers. It is something that many smart people had to spend considerable time thinking about. It may sound “boring”, but actually it is like with “choosing boring technology” which means “the capabilities and failure conditions are well understood”.\nWhen there is no explicit structure or hierarchy, the result is not freedom and egalitarianism (see The Tyranny of Structureless). Such orgs tend to be chaotic, fragile and frustrating.\nNo EMs because of management overhead (because managers are not supposed to do tech work) is a flawed argument. Mostly because “productivity” does not equate “lines of code”.",

Narcissists demand this right, then refuse to allow other points of view on the grounds that any other opinion somehow infringes their freedom of speech or is offensive.\n\n\nEveryone is an idiot from time to time.\n\n\n\nFirst Law\n(three circles and flowers)\n\nAfter my yarns with Percy, I begin to see the uncertainty principle not as a law but as an expression of frustration about the impossibility of achieving godlike scientific objectivity.\n\n\n\nForever limited\n\nSustainable systems cannot be manufactured by individuals or appointed committees, particularly during times of intense transition and upheaval.\n\n\nIdeas can be re-engineered to serve the interests of the powerful.\n\n(chekout Larry Gross, Post Apocaliptic Stress Syndrom).\n\n\nLines in the sand\n\nPeople today will mostly focus on the points of connection, the nodes of interest like stars in the sky. But the real understanding comes in the spaces in between, in the relational forces that connect and move the points.\n\n\nSystems are heterarchical – composed of equal parts interacting together. Imposing a hierarchical model of top-down control can only destroy them. Healthy interventions can only be made by free agents within a complex system.\n\n\nOn learning another culture (cultural humility): 1) Check your ego and motives, 2) You don’t need to be an expert to understand the knowledge process of people from other cultures and enter into dialogues with them (but you need to show respect), 3) Making yourself an expert in another culture is not always appreciated by the members of that culture.\n\n\nIt is difficult to relinquish the illusions of power and delusions of exceptionalism that come with privilege. But it is strangely liberating to realise your true status as a single node in a cooperative network.\n\n\nSustainable systems cannot function without the full autonomy and unique expression of each independent part of the interdependent whole.\n\n\nSustainability agents have a few simple operating guidelines, or network protocols, or rules if you like – connect, diversify, interact and adapt.\n\n\nAn agent that is truly adaptive and changing is open to sudden eruptions of transformation.\n\n\nNot all strange attractors are benevolent (narcissist).\n\n\nAdolescent cultures always ask the same three questions. Why are we here? How should we live? What will happen when we die?\n\n\n\nOf Spirit and Spirits\n\nThere are at least four parts to your spirit from an Aboriginal point of view: your higher self (superego), ancestral spirit, living spirit and shadow spirit… Your shadow spirit is that part of you that wants things you don’t need, makes you think you’re better than other people and above the land. If the rest of your spirit is not clear and in balance, it gets away from you, causing conflict and destruction. You gossip behind people’s backs, spread uncertainty, deliver judgments, upset people, take more than you need and accumulate goods without sharing. It makes you a competitor instead of a human being.\n\n                   =     metaphors   \n                //   \\\\    \nabstract       o      o   concrete\n                \\\\   //\n                   =    metaphors\n\nThere is a spark of creation like lightning when true learning takes place, with a genetic reward of chemical pleasure released in the brain… The chemical burst of pleasure we feel when genuine knowledge transmission takes place occurs from the creation of new neural pathways. These are connections between two points that were previously unconnected. Jokes are one of the most pure examples of this neural creation event… If people are laughing, they are learning.\n\n\nThere needs to be an interaction between abstract (spirit) and concrete (physical) worlds of knowledge for this kind of complexity to develop fully.\n\n\nWithout closing the loop between abstract knowledge and reality, and without making connections between different ideas and areas of knowledge, true learning cannot occur.\n\n\nA focus on linear, abstract, declarative knowledge alone not only fails to create complex connectivity but damages the mind. We are biologically punished for this destructive behaviour with a neuro-chemical rush of lethargy and discomfort that most people call boredom.\n\n\nKnowledge transmission must connect both abstract knowledge and concrete application through meaningful metaphors to be effective.\n\n\n\nAdvanced and Fair\nTODO",

The layers are reused for different images.\nOther useful commands: ENV, WORKDIR, USER, CMD\n\n\nNetwork\nBy default docker uses bridge mode for containers running on the same host with default network 172.17.xxx.xxx. Other network modes are “none” (no network) and “host” (no network isolation from host).\ndocker network create --driver bridge --subnet 182.18.0.0/16 my_network\ndocker inspect $name will show full container info including network.\nDockers uses internal DNS 127.0.0.11 to resolve containers IP and containers names.\n\n\nStorage\nContainers, images, volumes are stored in /var/lib/docker. All image layers are RO. A contaier runs in a special RW container layer which gets destroyed when container is stoped. Data can be persisted in named volumes inside /var/lib/docker/volumes (volume mount) or a directory on a host (bind mount).\ndocker volume create my_volume\ndocker run -v my_volume:/var/log my_image\n\n# new explicit format for mounting volumes\ndocker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/my_image/logs,target=/var/log my_image\n\n\nRemoving images\ndocker images\ndocker rmi &lt;image_id1&gt; &lt;image_id2&gt;\ndocker system prune -a\ndocker volume ls\ndocker volume rm &lt;volume_name1&gt; &lt;volume_name2&gt;\n\n\nDocker compose\nIt’s possible to run multiple containers and “link” them for networking. But much easier to use docker-compose to manage multi-container app.\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: 2\n\nservices:\n  frontend:\n    build:\n      context: ./app\n      args:\n        DB_HOST: localhost:5005\n    links:\n      - db\n    volumes:\n      - logs:/var/logs\n    depends_on:\n      db:\n        condition: service_started\n\n  db:\n    image: postgres:9.4\n    ports:\n      - \"5005:5432\"\n    volumes:\n      - /data/app/postgres:/var/lib/postgres\n\nvolumes:\n  logs:\ndocker-compose up -d   #--build\ndocker-compose exec frontend ls -l\ndocker-compose logs frontend\ndocker-compose down -v",
