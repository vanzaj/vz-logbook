I am planning a trip to Europe in January. Please help me find optimal travel plan. I would like to fly with a Star Alliance carrier. Departure date is January 9, 2026 (can be +/- 1 day). First destination is Paris, then Prague on January 11 then Geneva January 17. Return to Singapore on January 24 or 25. I am ok with traveling by train when in Europe.
