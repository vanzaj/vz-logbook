### [My Talks and tutorials](./mine.html)

Slides, GitHub repos, and video recordings of talks at various conferences from 2011 to present. Before that my talks where mostly about boring fMRI, ASL, and MRI image processing; mostly presented at [ISMRM](https://www.ismrm.org/) and related conferences.
