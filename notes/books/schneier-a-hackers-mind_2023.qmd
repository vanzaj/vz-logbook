Socio-technical systems. Humans + computers.
Complex systems are easier to hack.

Types of hacks: technical, economic, financial, legal, social, political, cognitive.

Hacking is exploiting a system without breaking the system's rules but subverting rules' intent for personal gain at the expense of the other participants in the system.

Good/useful hacks can be normalized (become part of the system) or patched. Non-technical hacks take years/generation to be patched.

Vulnerability and exploit.

Social hack: Administrative burden (make access to social benefits more difficult).

Hacks by AI systems: speed, scale, sophistication. Personalized, deep & subtle fakes.
