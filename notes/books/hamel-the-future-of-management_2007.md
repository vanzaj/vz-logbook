Management innovation is at least as important as technical innovation.

Examples:

  - Whole Food - community of purpose
  - Gore Tex - innovation democracy
  - Google - evolutionary advantage

New management practices:

  - generating options and selecting the best ones (Life, evolution).
  - routing of resourses (capital, talent, markets efficiency).
  - no feelings (apolitical).
  - diversity, open critique (democracy). 

religion: unlike science it tries to provide an answer to "who am i" and "why am i here".

> Most companies have a roughly similar management hierarchy, have analogous control systems, HR practices, planning rituals, and comparable reporting structures and review systems.

> What ultimately constrains the performance of your organization is not its operating model, nor its business model, but its management model.
