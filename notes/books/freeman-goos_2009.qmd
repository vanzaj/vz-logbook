Problem domain vs solution domain.

Video game example. Problem: actors, scene, effects... Solution: renderer, animator, collision detector...

An object is an implementation of one or more *roles*;
a *role* is a set of related *responsibilities*;
a *responsibility* is an obligation to perform a task or know information.

CRC cards: candidate, responsibilities, collaborators

> ...nothing forces us to understand a process better than trying to automate it.

1. Understand the problem
2. Broad-brush design
3. Automate: build, deployment, end-to-end test
4. ATDD-TDD cycle

Walking skeleton.
