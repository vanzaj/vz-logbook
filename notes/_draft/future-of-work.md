Q: How do you run and scale a company without bad bosses?
A: Don't have any bosses
Q: How do you run a company without bosses?

Teams have full freedom to decide how they work (meetings, decisions, work distribution, communication, feedback, conflicts,...)
Principle: Teams who are directly involved in the work are the ones who should have the autonomy to determine their operational methods.

How do we keep teams from moving (back) to more traditional approaches, without force or authority?
Setup a deep onboarding process to ensure people 'get it'. Provide ongoing training on progressive ways of working.
Continuously promote behaviors you'd like to see and discourage what you want to avoid.
Organize a project management community.
Setup buddy system for project managers.
Allow people to move around a lot (20% of people move to a new team in a given quarter).
Create a network of voluntary career coaches to support personal development.
Salaries based on input from colleagues + some ranking elements + a bit of algorithmic magic.
