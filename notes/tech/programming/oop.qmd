## Object oriented programming - the trillion dollar-disaster [^1]

The most important aspect of software development is keeping the code complexity down.

Big issues:

  - shared mutable state
  - wrong abstractions
  - low SNR (boilerplate code)

Trying to model programs as objects from real world is one of the biggest OOP mistakes.

The parent object in the real world is unable to change the behavior of child objects at run-time. You do not inherit "behaviors" from your parents; you develop your own behaviors. And you’re unable to "override" your parents’ behaviors.

The real world has no methods.
