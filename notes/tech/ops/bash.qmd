## Unit testing

One option is to use [Bach](https://bach.sh/) by the amazing [Chai Feng](https://github.com/chaifeng).

## Safer scripts

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euxo pipefail
```

- '-e' exit immediately on command fail
- '-u' treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately

- '-x' print each command before executing it
- '-o pipefail' sets the exit code of a pipeline to that of the rightmost command to exit with a non-zero status.

see: [safer bash scripts](https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/)

Also, always quote all variables.


## List uniq file extensions in a dir

```bash
for f in *; do echo ${f##*.}; done | sort | uniq`
```

## Heredoc

```bash
$ cat << END | wc -l
one
two
three
END
3
```
